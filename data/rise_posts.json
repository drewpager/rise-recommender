AI Content, Not Replacing Humans<\/h2>\r\nDo we think AI content generation tools are something to pay attention to?\r\n\r\nYes, but we don\u2019t think robots are coming for our jobs just yet. Our results show that 19% of businesses who use AI content generation tools report experiencing a very successful content strategy.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, 24% of businesses who don't use AI content generation tools also report experiencing a very successful content marketing strategy.\r\n\r\n<img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-31375\" src=\"\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/02\/content-marketing-trends-ai-generation-tools.png\" alt=\"A data visualization that represents if content marketers plan to use artificial intelligence in 2023 by Siege Media and Clearscope\" width=\"1400\" height=\"700\" \/>\r\n\r\nWhat do we think AI is best used for at this time?\r\n<ul>\r\n\r\n \t<li><strong>Blog title brainstorming:<\/strong> Type in your topic and content ideas to get some extra creativity in your writing process.<\/li>\r\n \t<li><strong>Email engagement:<\/strong> If you\u2019re struggling with email campaigns, AI content tools offer in-app suggestions for delivery times and personalized content.<\/li>\r\n \t<li><strong>Content outlines: <\/strong>Hitting a roadblock?

Generative AI is a force multiplier that will speed up content efforts and yield increased returns.\"\r\n\r\n<strong>Michael King, Founder, <a href=\"https:\/\/ipullrank.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">iPullRank<\/a><\/strong><\/blockquote>\r\n<blockquote class=\"definition\">\u201cThere's certainly a place for AI content in various marketing tactics and some content creation, but it can't compete with the quality that stems from real life experience and expertise. Perhaps that will change over time, but focusing on Google's notion of E-E-A-T is not only great for SEO, but also leads to higher quality content.\u201d\r\n\r\n<strong>Lily Ray, Senior Director of SEO, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.amsivedigital.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Amsive Digital<\/a><\/strong><\/blockquote>\r\n<h2 id=\"link-building\">3. Link Building Is Here To Stay<\/h2>\r\nWhile 64% of B2B businesses currently execute link building in their content marketing efforts versus 36% of their B2C counterparts, <strong>all businesses that incorporate link building report a 45% higher success rate<\/strong> in their overall content strategy than those that don\u2019t.\r\n\r\n<img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-31379\" src=\"\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/02\/content-marketing-trends-link-building.png\" alt=\"A data visualization that shows how prominent link building is in content marketers' strategies in 2023 by Siege Media and Clearscope\" width=\"1400\" height=\"575\" \/>\r\n\r\nHowever, the type of link building matters.\r\n\r\nThere\u2019s evident success in focusing on just passive link building and a plethora of <a href=\"https:\/\/www.siegemedia.com\/marketing\/link-building-strategies\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">link building strategies<\/a> to choose from that can naturally attract links to your site. The economics will continue to favor the use of a passive link strategy, such as with calculators, more than spending time completing manual outreach.\r\n<h3>What the Industry Is Saying<\/h3>\r\n<blockquote class=\"definition\">\u201cGoogle's PR messaging has worked to deflect the importance of links for years, but the reality is they remain significantly effective.\u201d\r\n\r\n<strong>Cyrus Shepard, Founder, <a href=\"https:\/\/zyppy.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Zyppy<\/a><\/strong><\/blockquote>\r\n<h2 id=\"content-design\">4.

Instead, the design within the content adds more value to the post itself, along with your content navigation and hub.\r\n\r\nTopical content like \u201cwhat is\u201d and informational posts are becoming more competitive as the SERP pages. Leveling up the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.siegemedia.com\/seo\/blog-best-practices-seo\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">blog design<\/a> around these types of content will help you stand out from the competition and improve your chances of ranking higher.\r\n<h2 id=\"interactive-content\">5. Don\u2019t Sleep on Interactive Content<\/h2>\r\nIt\u2019s no secret that interactives are magnets for link building and can almost single-handedly power your link acquisition strategy.\r\n\r\n<img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-31378\" src=\"\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/02\/content-marketing-trends-interactives.png\" alt=\"A graph that shows if content marketers are currently using interactive content in their content strategy by Siege Media and Clearscope\" width=\"1400\" height=\"575\" \/>\r\n\r\nPlus, it\u2019s significantly harder for a competitor to replicate that strategy. If you\u2019re a part of the 64% who don't leverage interactives, consider the number of passive links you may be missing out on.\r\n<h2 id=\"full-report\">Get More Trends in the Full Report<\/h2>\r\nUtilizing these upcoming marketing trends sooner than later will not only improve the overall aesthetic of your content but will prove to do well for the overall user experience.\r\n\r\nThese insights help us navigate the current state of our field and keep us ahead of the curve \u2014 increasing the chances of seeing success in content rankings and engagement.\r\n<blockquote class=\"definition\">\u201cIf you're creating content or if you need to start, this impressive data on the field's ins and outs is a must-read.\"\r\n\r\n<strong>Rand Fishkin, Co-Founder, <a href=\"https:\/\/sparktoro.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">SparkToro<\/a><\/strong><\/blockquote>\r\nDive deeper into all of our trends and insights \u2014 and stay ahead of the curve.\r\n\r\nLearn more about the future of AI content generation tools, how businesses budget their content marketing strategy, what it takes to see success, and much more.

Content marketing that uses artificial intelligence (AI). \r\n\r\nThere are a variety of tools on the market, but some of the most exciting \u2014 and maybe problematic \u2014 are the robo-writing tools. These are tools marketers can use to generate blog posts, press releases, website copy, social media copy, or even video scripts. \r\n\r\nMany robo-writers use <a href=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/seo\/gpt3\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">GPT-3,<\/a> an AI language generator created by Open AI. GPT-3 is a complex language model that can generate human-like content from just a few words.\r\n\r\nThe biggest selling point for these tools is that they can create content quickly and at a fraction of the cost of hiring a writer. \r\n\r\nBut you might not want to get rid of your writing staff just yet.\r\n\r\n<h2>Will AI Content Work for SEO?<\/h2>\r\nLet\u2019s address the elephant in the room. We do create human content, so we could see how you might thing we'd be naturally against AI content. That's reasonable, but we have a business value of \"Strive to be Better\" \u2014 and if it means incorporating AI to create better content, we are very happy to do it.\r\n\r\nWe truly believe that AI content marketing can\u2019t replace humans, but it could add value to the content humans create.\r\n\r\nWe see AI being useful for brainstorming titles or post ideas, helping spot grammar mistakes, or giving general suggestions to simplify copy.\r\n\r\nBut we don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s good at creating:\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Comprehensive outlines for SEO content<\/li>\r\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/marketing\/creative-content\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Creative content<\/a><\/li>\r\n<li>A quality long-form narrative<\/li>\r\n<li>Content that's additive to existing results<\/li>\r\n<li>Design that adds value<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n\r\nTo answer the question: Will AI work for SEO content? Well, maybe. But we don&rsquo;t recommend letting it create content from start to finish. And it&rsquo;s definitely not going to replace human creativity anytime soon.\r\n\r\n<h2>The Pitfalls Of AI Generated Content<\/h2>\r\nLet's try something really fast.\r\n\r\nI'm going to show you two pieces of content highlighting some of the pitfalls of AI content writing tools. \r\n\r\nOne's human ... the other ... isn\u2019t.\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/02\/human-writing-vs-ai-writing.png\" alt=\"An image comparing the differences between human-generated copy and ai-generated copy\" width=\"1400\" height=\"1663\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-31196 bordered\" \/>\r\n\r\nMaybe that example is a little extreme. I mean, I\u2019m pretty sure I\u2019m human, so if I really focus, I can nail that whole conversational tone, right? \r\n\r\nLet\u2019s take a deeper look here and dissect what makes my writing human and AI writing not. \r\n\r\n<h3>Voice And Tone Matter<\/h3>\r\nAs you read this, think about how it might sound. \r\n\r\nThe pauses. The cadence. The tone. \r\n\r\nAI hasn\u2019t grasped the nuances of human language. It's built on great big data sets, and while it can spot patterns with natural language processing, it doesn't feel anything. That's super important when you want a piece of content that engages readers. \r\n\r\nAnyone, man or robot, can spew out an informative piece of content that satisfies the absolute bare minimum that Google wants. And you know what? It may even get you to the first page if it&rsquo;s not <a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=Yx997SsiYlw&amp;t=1334s\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">flagged as spam<\/a>.\r\n\r\nBut look at top content producers. Look at the SEO heavyweights. \r\n\r\nThey have a voice. \r\n\r\nThat&rsquo;s what turns a good blog post <a href=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/creation\/what-makes-good-blog-post\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">into a great one<\/a>.\r\n\r\n<h3>AI Content Is Limited To Fragments<\/h3>\r\nAI content writing tools create content by scraping the web for relevant posts and then stitching it together so that it's vaguely readable.\r\n\r\nThat means it can only create something that already exists in one form or another. Oftentimes, when it\u2019s slapped together, it doesn\u2019t feel like a single piece of fluid content.\r\n\r\nEver seen the movie <a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=lyy7y0QOK-0\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Chappie<\/a>? It&rsquo;s about an innocent robot whose genius creator tries to instill wholesome moral teachings, but the robot is stolen by a quirky pair of gangsters looking for trouble.\r\n\r\nThroughout the film, the robot, Chappie, adopts different traits from both of its teachers. I\u2019ll save you the synopsis, but you can notice a little of this in these AI content writing tools.\r\n\r\nBecause they pull info from anywhere and everywhere and then Frankenstein it all together, you may end up with a piece of content that\u2019s a little bit wholesome computer wiz and a little bit criminal underground.\r\n\r\nEven worse, there\u2019s no guarantee that it\u2019s original \u2014 this comes with its own problems. \r\n\r\n<h3>Design Is Everything<\/h3>\r\nWe love our designers here at Siege. We genuinely couldn\u2019t do this without them.\r\n\r\nDesign is a huge part of <a href=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/seo\/how-to-rank-higher-on-google\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">creating content that ranks<\/a>.\r\n\r\nOur design strategy begins as we\u2019re outlining a post. We chat with designers throughout the entire process, sharing ideas to hone in on exactly the visualization we feel a piece of content needs to take it to the next level.\r\n\r\nSure, AI can \u201cdesign,\u201d but you\u2019ll still have to tell it what to create. Plus, the end result can be a little weird, to say the least.\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/01\/human-design-vs-ai-design.png\" alt=\"An image showing two illustrations of human design vs. AI design\" width=\"1400\" height=\"1170\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-31176\" \/>\r\n\r\nNow just imagine trying to tell it to create an infographic showing marketing statistics. \r\n\r\n<h3>AI Kills Creativity<\/h3>  \r\nListen, AI is great. It plays a key role in our daily lives. From traffic lights to Google searches, it\u2019s everywhere. But overreliance on AI can take the spark out of life. No one wants Siri to manage every aspect of their existence, after all.  \r\n\r\nYou need spontaneity and creativity. This is something AI just can\u2019t offer. Creative content is fun to read, and it\u2019s good for rankings. \r\n\r\nThere is a lot that goes into our content ideas here at Siege. In fact, we&rsquo;ve created a whole methodology we like to call <a href=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/creation\/seo-friendly-content#:~:text=Create%20Out%2Dof%2Dthe%2DBox%20Content%20With%20V.I.N.E.S\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">V.I.N.E.S.<\/a> to keep content creative and interesting.\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/keep-readers-entertained-vines-acronym.png\" alt=\"Make creative content by looking to video, images, news, experts, and social for inspiration.\" width=\"1401\" height=\"422\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-28038\" \/>\r\n\r\nV.I.N.E.S. is our out-of-the-box research method. In short, we scour the web for:\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><strong>V<\/strong>ideos<\/li>\r\n<li><strong>I<\/strong>mages<\/li>\r\n<li><strong>N<\/strong>ews<\/li>\r\n<li><strong>E<\/strong>xpert commentary<\/li>\r\n<li><strong>S<\/strong>ocial media<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n\r\nThis helps us create content that readers are actually looking for. \r\n\r\nAI regurgitates what\u2019s already out there, so when Google sees more of the same, why would they rank it higher than what\u2019s tried and true? \r\n\r\nTo drive meaningful results, you need to build meaningful traffic. And that comes from out-of-the-box thinking. Unfortunately, AI content is very far inside the box.\r\n\r\nAnd while AI pulls content from all over, it can\u2019t compete with content built from research across multiple mediums. \r\n\r\nDo you think AI is looking at Etsy shopping trends to create a post about bachelorette party gifts? We\u2019re willing to bet it isn\u2019t. \r\n\r\n<h3>Google Is Smart<\/h3>\r\nAnd its AI is probably better than yours.\r\n\r\nGoogle's AI can tell if your content was written by a human or a robot. And guess what? It&rsquo;s not a fan of robo-content. In fact, it sees AI-generated content as spam, which is <a href=\"https:\/\/www.searchenginejournal.com\/google-says-ai-generated-content-is-against-guidelines\/444916\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">against its guidelines<\/a>.\r\n\r\nEven if it\u2019s good, AI-generated content won\u2019t pass the AI sniff test. Google wants content that engages users and adds value. AI-generated content can only take from what already exists. \r\n\r\nAI content tools can be useful for identifying trends or topics you should cover, but they\u2019re no substitute for quality research and analysis backed up by data. AI won\u2019t create a masterpiece of an article with compelling insight \u2014 it just can\u2019t think like a human can.\r\n\r\n<h3>Quantity Isn\u2019t Always a Good Thing<\/h3>\r\nAI content marketing tools might help create a ton of content quickly. They may even generate some decent short-term results, especially if you\u2019re targeting lower-difficulty terms.\r\n\r\nBut that isn\u2019t necessarily a good thing. In fact, high publishing volume may even hurt your traffic in the long run. Although our data below doesn't reflect AI-generated content, it does reflect low-quality content \u2014 resulting in similar outcomes.\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/02\/high-publishing-volume-long-term.jpg\" alt=\"A graph showing that high publishing volume of content can hurt long term\" width=\"1400\" height=\"800\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-31192\" \/>\r\n\r\nWhy? \r\n\r\nWell, it won\u2019t attract links, and (perhaps more importantly) readers won\u2019t engage with your content. High-quality content will keep readers on the page for longer, showing Google that your content is actually helpful. A burst of lower-quality content that users might not engage with, however, will show Google just the opposite.\r\n\r\n<h2>AI Content Marketing Tools Do Have Some Benefits<\/h2>\r\nSo we\u2019ve been pretty harsh on AI content, but AI content marketing tools do have some benefits. \r\n\r\nThey can spot grammar mistakes you may have missed, improve the readability of your content, and even help cure writer's block. But they\u2019re not a substitute for human creativity. \r\n\r\nIf you insist on using AI content marketing tools, take a look at these dos and don'ts first:\r\n\r\n<strong>Do:<\/strong>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Use AI content tools to help identify gaps in your content strategy. AI can help you quickly research topics and suggest potential titles for your blog posts, articles, or other content.<\/li>\r\n<li>Take advantage of AI's ability to help you with grammar and spelling mistakes. AI tools (mixed with the expertise of a copy editor) can help you catch major spelling and syntax errors.<\/li>\r\n<li>Use AI to test out different ideas before committing to a certain strategy or approach. AI can provide insights into what&rsquo;s performing well in the market, so you don't have to experiment too much on your own.&nbsp;<\/li>\r\n<li>Invest time into learning how AI works and what it can do. The better you understand AI, the more you can get out of it.&nbsp;<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n\r\n<strong>Don&rsquo;t:<\/strong>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Rely solely on AI content tools without any human input or oversight. AI is only as good as the data it is given, so AI content tools should always be double-checked by a human.&nbsp;<\/li>\r\n<li>Use AI to replace creative work entirely. AI can provide insights and help steer your content creation in the right direction, but AI cannot replace creativity or storytelling skills.&nbsp;<\/li>\r\n<li>Forget that AI has limitations. AI isn't perfect, and it's important to remember this and adjust accordingly when creating content with AI content tools.&nbsp;<\/li>\r\n<li>Jump into using AI without doing your own research first. AI tools pull from information across the web, but if you've spent even five seconds on the internet, you know that not all of that information is reliable.<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/01\/dos-and-donts-of-ai-content-marketing-tools.png\" alt=\"An image showing the dos and don&#039;ts of AI content marketing tools\" width=\"1400\" height=\"1400\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-31175 bordered\" \/>\r\n\r\n<h2>What Are Some Of The Top AI Content Marketing Tools?<\/h2>\r\nThere are a ton of AI  tools out there, and they all come with some pretty big promises. And while we don\u2019t use AI content marketing tools at Siege, there are a few that we think are interesting. \r\n\r\n<h3><a href=\"https:\/\/openai.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">OpenAI<\/a><\/h3>\r\nOpen AI just released one of the most exciting leaps in AI content development with its ChatGPT language model.\r\n\r\nIt\u2019s so good, in fact, that I\u2019m going to let it tell you about itself:\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/01\/chatgpt.jpg\" alt=\"An image showing an example of ChatGPT\" width=\"1024\" height=\"396\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-31183\" \/>\r\n\r\nBasically, it\u2019s the most human-sounding AI content tool\u2026ever. And it\u2019s completely free. Though it\u2019s not without its flaws. \r\n\r\nSome of ChatGPT&rsquo;s limitations include:\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Plausible but factually incorrect outputs<\/li>\r\n<li>Rigid and presumptive responses to more open-ended inquiries<\/li>\r\n<li>Overuses some phrases<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n\r\nIt\u2019s also worth noting that there are already other AI tools popping up left and right that aim to detect whether or not AI wrote a piece of content. \r\n\r\nSo, while it may be one of the most advanced and exciting AI tools to date, it\u2019s not quite ready to replace humans completely. But it could be a great resource to speed up and add to your natural creativity and flair. \r\n\r\n<img src=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/01\/chatgpt-2.jpg\" alt=\"An image showing an example of ChatGPT\" width=\"1024\" height=\"396\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-31182\" \/>\r\n\r\nOk, ChatGPT, we get it. \r\n\r\n<h3><a href=\"https:\/\/www.grammarly.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Grammarly<\/a><\/h3>\r\n\r\nMicrosoft Word has had spell check for as long as we can remember, but Grammarly takes it to the next level. \r\n\r\nGrammarly is an AI-powered tool that can help you edit and proofread your content quickly and (mostly) accurately. It also provides suggestions to improve the quality of your writing and even ensure you didn't accidentally plagiarize any of your copy. \r\n\r\nThere is a free version and a paid version. The free version is pretty basic, tagging only the simplest mistakes, while the paid version costs $144 per year and provides suggestions to improve readability, clarity, and delivery.\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/01\/grammarly.jpg\" alt=\"An image showing an example of Grammarly\" width=\"1024\" height=\"600\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-31184\" \/>\r\n\r\nWhile Grammarly is pretty sophisticated, it\u2019s not perfect, so be sure to double-check its suggestions if you do decide to use it.\r\n\r\n<h3><a href=\"https:\/\/hemingwayapp.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Hemingway Editor<\/a><\/h3>\r\n\r\nThe late, great Ernest Hemingway had a knack for keeping things simple. And with Hemingway Editor, you can channel your inner Ernest. \r\n\r\nThe free app can help you edit your copy for clarity, readability, and brevity. It\u2019s a straightforward tool without any bells and whistles. It does one thing, and it does it well.\r\n\r\nAll you need to do is copy a piece of content into the app, and it will show you the content's readability and where you can improve it. \r\n\r\nTake a look: \r\n\r\n<img src=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/01\/hemmingway.jpg\" alt=\"An image showing a screenshot of Hemingway\" width=\"1024\" height=\"600\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-31185\" \/>\r\n\r\n<h3><a href=\"https:\/\/buzzsumo.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">BuzzSumo<\/a><\/h3>\r\nBuzzsumo uses AI to scan the web, analyzing engagement levels and trends to provide you with topic suggestions. It also has built-in search filters so you can easily find what kind of topics are trending and popular within your niche. \r\n\r\n<img src=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/01\/buzzsumo.jpg\" alt=\"An image displaying a screenshot of Buzzsumo\" width=\"1024\" height=\"750\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-31181\" \/>\r\n\r\nUsing it, you'll be able to identify the most engaging content for your target audience quickly. This AI tool is great for helping you create content that will stand out from the competition and maximize your reach.\r\n\r\nBuzzSumo has a free version, but if you want to unlock all of its features, you\u2019ll need to fork out $299 per month. \r\n\r\n<h3><a href=\"https:\/\/www.jasper.ai\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Jasper.ai<\/a><\/h3>\r\nJasper.ai is an AI-powered content generation tool that can help kickstart content creation. \r\n\r\n<img src=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/01\/jasper.jpg\" alt=\"An image showing an example of Jasper\" width=\"1024\" height=\"750\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-31186\" \/>\r\n\r\nThis tool can take a single sentence and turn it into an entire blog post, article, or webpage in minutes. But that doesn't mean the content is always good \u2014 or unique. And don\u2019t forget, Google sees AI-generated content as spam, which is a big no-no. \r\n\r\nYou can use Jasper for inspiration, but be careful not to use it as a crutch! \r\n\r\nAt $109 per month, it's not for everyone, so consider if you really need AI-powered content creation or if a human writer can serve the same purpose.\r\n\r\n<h2>So, Is AI Easy-Mode For Content Creators?<\/h2>\r\n\r\nOf course, we\u2019re averse to AI content tools here at Siege. They\u2019re in competition with our business model. But we\u2019ll be the first to acknowledge that they could be helpful if you use them correctly.  And at the rate things are developing, it would be silly not to acknowledge how important these tools could become.\r\n\r\nAI content marketing tools can save time, spot errors, and improve the quality of content. But it'll be a long time before they replace human writers. \r\n\r\nAt Siege, we take serious pride in our content, and good content is built on creativity, not cutting corners. \r\n\r\nReady to create something amazing together? <a href=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/business-form\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Drop us a line<\/a>."

However, there really isn\u2019t a perfect metric. \r\n\r\nInstead, you can start by using images to compliment your post structure. \r\n\r\nFor example, a great spot for you to insert a blog post image is directly following an H2 header so that you can set the tone for copy in that section. \r\n\r\n<blockquote class=\"definition\">We dive more into how to structure your posts for SEO <a href=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/seo\/post-structure-for-seo\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">here<\/a>.<\/blockquote>\r\n\r\nBe mindful, though, and try not to plug an image into your content just for the sake of having something there.\r\n\r\nGive every visual a purpose, but treat your blog like a YouTube video, and break up those long, drawn-out monologues with a visual to keep users engaged and help reduce reading fatigue.\r\n\r\nComb through your post and be your own audience. If you feel that there\u2019s an opportunity to enhance or further help convey a point, consider adding an image. \r\n\r\nHere is a helpful list of image ideas to break up your <a href=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/marketing\/creative-content\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">creative blog content<\/a> and keep your audience engaged:\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Data visualizations<\/li>\r\n<li>Surveys and statistics<\/li>\r\n<li>Stock images<\/li>\r\n<li>eBooks and tools<\/li>\r\n<li>Pull quotes<\/li>\r\n<li>Newsletter CTAs<\/li>\r\n<li>Bulleted lists<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n\r\n<h2>2. Design for the SERP<\/h2>\r\nMarketers and SEOs alike often ignore the power of imagery in regards to the SERP. \r\n\r\nThe Google images tab will give you a good indication of things people <i>actually<\/i> want to see in their search queries. \r\n\r\n<img src=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/10\/how-to-use-google-images-tab-to-rank.jpg\" alt=\"google image tab screenshots compared to show a search result with mostly photos vs one that shows illustrations\" width=\"1400\" height=\"1444\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-30288\" \/>\r\n\r\nYou should take advantage of this feature early in your writing process so you can tailor your copy around an image \u2014 not the other way around.\r\n\r\nThere\u2019s another key element on the Google Images tab to look for when designing an image for your blog post. You\u2019ll notice occasionally that image results for your searches contain actionable tips or relevant information.\r\n\r\nThis is a key takeaway when it comes to deciding whether to include a stock image for a topic versus something more meaningful, such as a data visualization.\r\n\r\nUltimately, ask yourself this: \u201cIf I remove the context from my blog post image, does it have the capability to stand on its own?\u201d\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/10\/blog-post-image-context-test.png\" alt=\"pull quote about blog post image context\" width=\"1400\" height=\"890\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-30291\" \/>\r\n\r\nIf your visual has no purpose other than to look pretty, it\u2019s probably best to remove it entirely and focus on something that has a chance to generate clicks.\r\n\r\nHere are some action items to help you start designing for the SERP:\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Reference the Google images tab to see what\u2019s ranking<\/li>\r\n<li>Look for ways to stand out visually from what already exists<\/li>\r\n<li>Identify opportunities where you can elevate an existing image with key information<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n\r\nDo you need to create every image in your post with image queries in mind? Definitely not, but ignoring Google Images completely means you\u2019re practically throwing away clicks. \r\n\r\nCheck out our video below for an even deeper dive on how to use Google images to rank better.\r\n\r\n<div class=\"video-container\"><iframe width=\"700\" height=\"394\" src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/fQtG9aZeM3Q\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen><\/iframe><\/div>\r\n\r\n<h2>3. Adopt a Mobile-First Mentality<\/h2>\r\nAccording to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.statista.com\/statistics\/277125\/share-of-website-traffic-coming-from-mobile-devices\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Statista<\/a>, mobile devices generate nearly 60% of global web traffic in 2022, and that number is only expected to grow. \r\n\r\nWhile it\u2019s easy to first think about the desktop user experience, it\u2019s important to keep in mind that horizontal blog images may not translate well on mobile devices \u2014 particularly the images that contain text.\r\n\r\n<blockquote class=\"definition\">53% of mobile users will close a website if it takes more than three seconds to load. (Think With Google via <i>Siege Media's <a href=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/strategy\/content-marketing-statistics#ch2\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">100 Must-Know Content Marketing Statistics<\/a><\/i>)<\/blockquote>\r\n\r\nIf any of your blog post images do contain text, check how small the font appears on a tablet or phone. Too-small text leads to a negative user experience and may actually reduce the user\u2019s session duration.\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/10\/desktop-vs-mobile-image-text-readability.png\" alt=\"text becoming too small on a mobile vs desktop display\" width=\"1400\" height=\"1350\" class=\"image--desktop alignnone size-full wp-image-30295\" \/>\r\n\r\n<img class=\"image--mobile alignnone wp-image-30294 size-full\" src=\"\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/10\/desktop-vs-mobile-image-text-readability_mobile.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"700\" height=\"1802\" \/>\r\n\r\nIn our list of <a href=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/seo\/blog-best-practices-seo\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">blog design best practices<\/a>, we strongly suggest that blog copy on any screen should be 16\u201318pt minimum to optimize user readability.\r\n\r\nAs a rule of thumb, if your blog\u2019s desktop display is wider than 600px, your image copy on mobile could be nearing an unreadable font size.\r\n\r\nIf you want two completely different images to show on mobile versus desktop you can include both images on the page with different CSS classes like this:\r\n\r\n<pre><code class=\"language-markup\">\r\n<img class=\"mobile-image\" src=\"PathToMobileImg.jpg\" \/>\r\n<img class=\"desktop-image\" src=\"PathToDesktopImg.jpg\" \/>\r\n<\/code><\/pre>\r\n\r\nThen in your style.css you can hide the version you don't want to show depending on the version of the site being displayed:\r\n\r\n<pre><code class=\"language-css\">\/* hide mobile show desktop *\/\r\n@media only screen and (min-width: 992px) {\r\n    .mobile-image {\r\n        display:none;\r\n    }\r\n    .desktop-image {\r\n        display:block;\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n\r\n\/* show mobile hide desktop *\/\r\n@media only screen and (max-width: 991px) {\r\n    .mobile-image {\r\n        display:block;\r\n    }\r\n    .desktop-image {\r\n        display:none;\r\n    }\r\n}<\/code><\/pre>\r\n\r\nSo, if you find that your blog images are difficult to read on smaller screens, create and display a mobile-oriented version instead.\r\n\r\n<h2>4. Consider the Fold<\/h2>\r\nHeader images, also known as hero images, are great for conveying a visual representation of your entire article.\r\n\r\nHowever, if not handled properly, a header image can actually negatively impact user experience while simultaneously forcing important keywords beneath the fold.\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/10\/hero-image-size-comparison-v2.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1400\" height=\"941\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-30331\" \/>\r\n\r\nConsider the two examples above. \r\n\r\nOn the left, you\u2019ll see a hero image that takes up the full blog width and pushes two precious paragraphs of content below the fold. \r\n\r\nOn the right side, you\u2019ll see an image that retains visual significance while prioritizing the keyword above the fold.\r\n\r\nWhile there\u2019s no universal metric to calculate hero image height, I find that displaying images around 450px tall on desktop and 225px tall on mobile is often a good balance for prioritizing keywords.\r\n\r\nOne additional bonus of having a shorter hero image is that you\u2019ll likely produce smaller file sizes, leading to faster page load speeds.\r\n\r\n<h2>5. Avoid Embedded Text<\/h2>\r\nWhile companies are making incredible leaps in <a href=\"https:\/\/aws.amazon.com\/what-is\/ocr\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Optical Character Recognition<\/a> (OCR) technology, we\u2019re not at the point yet where we can afford to let images do all of the talking.\r\n\r\nWhile blog post images should compliment the information at hand, always ensure that certain key text is still maintained within the blog copy itself so that search engines can crawl it successfully.\r\n\r\nHere is a list of text elements that you should avoid embedding solely within blog post images:\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Keywords<\/li>\r\n<li>H1s and H2s<\/li>\r\n<li>URLs or anchor text<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n\r\nWhile it\u2019s okay for your images to contain the items from the list above, they shouldn\u2019t be the only source for that information.\r\n\r\nThis is important for two main reasons:\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>First, text translation tools cannot access embedded text, leading to a bad user experience for those trying to read through your article in a language that is easier for them to digest the information.<\/li>\r\n<li>Second, some users may not have access to view your images, and context will therefore be missing when the article jumps paragraphs without the warning of a now-missing H2.<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n\r\nThis leads me directly into the next topic: ADA compliance.\r\n\r\n<h2>6. Abide by ADA Compliance<\/h2>\r\nA <a href= \"https:\/\/chainstoreage.com\/study-most-websites-fail-comply-ada-accessibility-requirements#:~:text=Non%2Dcompliance%20with%20the%20WCAG,links%20(22%25%20fail).\u201d target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">study done in 2020<\/a> found that about 52% of web images actually fail to meet the accessibility requirements under the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) Standards for Accessible Design.\r\n\r\nLuckily, there are three actions to help optimize accessibility for your blog post images:\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Add alt text to every blog image<\/li>\r\n<li>Don\u2019t forget about dark mode users<\/li>\r\n<li>Use proper color contrast<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n\r\n<h3>Add Alt Text to Every Image<\/h3>\r\nAlt text (sometimes called an alt tag or alt description) is primarily used for those with visual impairments or lower internet speeds, but it\u2019s also <a href=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/creation\/seo-friendly-content\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">very important for SEO-friendly content<\/a>. \r\n\r\nIf you\u2019ve ever had a poor internet connection, alt text was likely what you saw in place of an image that failed to load. In other words, alt text is a descriptive sentence assigned to an image in order to convey context. \r\n\r\nThis description is also used by search engines to better crawl through your page and understand what your post is about, making it directly impactful in where your site ranks in the SERP.\r\n\r\nYour CMS most definitely has a dedicated area to include alt text when uploading images, so take full advantage and add descriptions to every image.\r\n\r\n<h3>Don\u2019t Forget About Dark Mode Users<\/h3>\r\nIf you\u2019re like me, you find the white backgrounds of most web pages and apps to be harsh on the eyes.\r\n\r\nIn 2019, iOS and Android both introduced dark mode, which inverts your screen to show white text on a black background. \r\n\r\nDark mode has been one of my favorite additions to mobile user experience since its release, hands down. In fact, more than 80% of Android owners use dark mode, according to a study by <a href=\"https:\/\/www.androidauthority.com\/dark-mode-poll-results-1090716\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">AndroidAuthority<\/a>.\r\n\r\nSo, where does dark mode tie into blog post images? It all boils down to image transparency.\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/10\/image-transparency-on-light-vs-dark-mode.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1400\" height=\"921\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-30299\" \/>\r\n\r\nImage transparency refers to the see-through portions of an image file, which is typically a PNG file type. \r\n\r\nTransparency in blog post images can negatively impact your user experience, because any dark text will have extremely low contrast and appear missing to a dark mode user. \r\n\r\nTherefore, the best way to optimize images for both dark and light mode users is to add a background color (like white) behind any images containing text.\r\n\r\n<h3>Use Proper Color Contrast<\/h3>\r\nYou may love the color yellow, but it\u2019s a safe bet to assume that it won\u2019t be readable on a white background.\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/10\/web-color-contrast-ratio-pass-vs-fail-v2.jpg\" alt=\"web color contrast pass vs fail comparison\" width=\"1400\" height=\"1523\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-30669\" \/>\r\n\r\nWhile this example is more obvious, there are certainly other color combinations that fail to meet <a href=\"https:\/\/www.w3.org\/WAI\/standards-guidelines\/wcag\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Web Content Accessibility Guidelines<\/a> (WCAG), which are in place to ensure all online users have equal accessibility.\r\n\r\nIn fact, a study by <a href=\"https:\/\/webaim.org\/projects\/million\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">WebAIM<\/a>  found that nearly 84% of home pages contained low contrast text, the most common accessibility issue. \r\n\r\nWhile black text on a white background provides the best possible contrast ratio for text readability, don\u2019t let that shy you away from using your brand\u2019s colors.\r\n\r\nWhen in doubt, use an online contrast checker and aim for a minimum color contrast ratio of 4.5:1. \r\n\r\n<h2>7. Upgrade With Screenshots<\/h2>\r\nOptimized imagery doesn't always require fancy design. Sometimes, a screenshot (with a little flare) is all you need to elevate your content. \r\n\r\n<img src=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/10\/bad-vs-good-screenshot-example-v2.jpg\" alt=\"comparison of an unedited vs edited screenshot\" width=\"1400\" height=\"1490\" class=\"image--desktop alignnone size-full wp-image-30329\" \/>\r\n\r\n<img class=\"image--mobile alignnone wp-image-30290 size-full\" src=\"\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/10\/bad-vs-good-screenshot-example_mobile.jpg\" alt=\"comparison of an unedited vs edited screenshot\" width=\"700\" height=\"1572\" \/>\r\n\r\nUse these three steps and start introducing a unique post image into your repertoire: \r\n\r\n<h4>1. Take Higher-Quality Screenshots<\/h4>\r\nZoom in on your screen before taking a screenshot. Crawlable text and live charts will appear infinitely more crisp the closer you are to them. \r\n\r\n<h4>2. Add a Border or Background Color<\/h4>\r\nInclude branded elements in your screenshots by adding a border or background color. \r\n\r\nNot only do these help the screenshot stand out from the copy, they also create visual ties back to your brand.\r\n\r\n<h4>3. Include a Callout<\/h4>\r\nIntroducing a circle or rectangle around an area of interest of your screenshot can increase scannability for your audience.\r\n\r\nIt will also provide context without muddying an image that already has a ton of text.\r\n\r\n<h2>8. Optimize Files for Page Load Speeds<\/h2>\r\nOn average, blog post images account for more than 40% of your page load speed, according to studies done by <a href=\"https:\/\/searchengineland.com\/images-easiest-page-speed-win-269742#:~:text=More%20often%20than%20not%20in,before%20you%20upload%20your%20images%3F\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Search Engine Land<\/a>.\r\n\r\nWhile this statistic can be discouraging, there are easy ways to determine whether you\u2019re using the most optimal format for your needs or if you\u2019re causing an unnecessary slowdown on your blog.\r\n\r\nJPG and PNG are the two most commonly used image formats, and there are advantages and disadvantages when choosing between them.\r\n\r\nIn the next section, I\u2019ll show you not only how to choose the right image format for your needs, but I\u2019ll also give you an even deeper dive into an optimizing technique that your competition doesn't even know about.\r\n\r\n<h3>JPG vs. PNG: When To Use Each<\/h3>\r\nUnfortunately, there\u2019s no one-size-fits-all file type for blog post images. \r\n\r\nJPGs and PNGs have advantages over one another, and it gets understandably difficult to keep track of their differences.\r\n\r\nTherefore, I\u2019ve put together a helpful list of benefits to help you determine which file type you should use to maximize your page loading times.\r\n\r\nUse a JPG file type when:\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Your image contains stock photography<\/li>\r\n<li>Your image contains thousands of colors<\/li>\r\n<li>Image quality is not of maximum importance<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n\r\nUse a PNG file type when:\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Your image contains vector illustrations<\/li>\r\n<li>Your image contains very few colors<\/li>\r\n<li>Your image contains transparency<\/li>\r\n<li>Image quality is very important<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/10\/image-file-type-cheat-sheet-2.png\" alt=\"pros and cons between two popular image file types\" width=\"1400\" height=\"1272\" class=\"image--desktop alignnone size-full wp-image-30313\" \/>\r\n\r\n<img class=\"image--mobile alignnone wp-image-30297 size-full\" src=\"\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/10\/image-file-type-cheat-sheet_mobile.png\" alt=\"pros and cons between two popular image file types\" width=\"700\" height=\"2055\" \/>\r\n\r\n<h4>What about WebP Files?<\/h4>\r\nThe WebP file type is still rather new, and even though these files tend to be smaller in size, it\u2019s worth noting that not every browser supports them \u2014 yet. \r\n\r\nOnce the older browsers stop receiving support, you\u2019ll start to see WebP formatted images a <i>lot<\/i> more. Until then, use them at your own risk.\r\n\r\n<h3>Upload \u201cProgressive\u201d and \u201cInterlaced\u201d Images<\/h3>\r\nI\u2019m going to get technical for a moment. \r\n\r\nWhile prioritizing file size gets us most of the way towards proper image optimization, there\u2019s actually another image-exporting technique that often gets overlooked. \r\n\r\nThis technique affects how quickly your image physically appears on your page, and I guarantee it\u2019s one that many aren\u2019t putting into practice.\r\n\r\n<h4>JPG: Progressive Image Benefits<\/h4>\r\nJPG file types have the option of being saved out with two different presets: progressive and optimized.\r\n\r\nDon\u2019t let the word \u201coptimized\u201d fool you here. Always choose progressive.\r\n\r\n<video autoplay muted loop controls src=\"\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/10\/blog-image-load-time-comparison.mp4\"><\/video>\r\n\r\nTake a look at the diagram above. There is a ton of technical jargon behind this, but the TL;DR version is this:\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Progressive JPGs appear instantly and increase in clarity as the page continues to load.<\/li>\r\n<li>Optimized JPGs start as a chunk of blank space until the entirety of the image can be loaded.<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n\r\nSeeing a blank space on a website is just bad user experience with the potential of a higher bounce rate, so always export progressive JPGs for your blog post images.\r\n\r\n<h4>PNG: Interlaced Image Benefits<\/h4>\r\nIn short, an interlaced PNG is the exact same concept as a progressive JPG. \r\n\r\nAn interlaced PNG is better than one that is non-interlaced, because this preset ensures that there is an image loaded immediately on the page.\r\n\r\nAlways choose the interlaced PNG preset for your blog post images.\r\n\r\n<h2>9. Upload Images at 2x Size<\/h2>\r\nWelcome to the world of Retina displays. \r\n\r\nIf you want to maximize image quality, especially on mobile, you\u2019re going to want to start exporting your images twice as large.\r\n\r\nThey still display at 1x the size on your blog, but there\u2019s a world of a difference in image detail when you resize a 1600px wide image into an 800px wide space.\r\n\r\nThe non-technical reason is because there are more pixels being jammed into a smaller space, thus giving the appearance of crispness. \r\n\r\nOne thing you need to keep in mind, however, is that a 2x file is going to affect page load speed due to the larger file size, but here\u2019s a little secret:\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/10\/2x-vs-1x-image-quality-comparison-2.jpg\" alt=\"comparison of two images saved with different export settings\" width=\"1400\" height=\"1367\" class=\"image--desktop alignnone size-full wp-image-30314\" \/>\r\n\r\n<img class=\"image--mobile alignnone wp-image-30289 size-full\" src=\"\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/10\/2x-vs-1x-image-quality-comparison_mobile.jpg\" alt=\"comparison of two images saved with different export settings\" width=\"700\" height=\"2172\" \/>\r\n\r\nAs you can see above, a 2x image saved at 50% quality will still appear sharper than a 1x image saved at 100% quality. \r\n\r\nThey\u2019re both going to be about the same file size, but it\u2019s those extra pixels that make all of the difference in image quality.\r\n\r\n<h2>10. Compress, Compress, Compress<\/h2>\r\nOne problem you\u2019re bound to run into is a significantly slowed down page load speed with too many blog post images. \r\n\r\nThis is especially apparent in blog post types like listicles and how-to guides, which often require anywhere from 10\u201320 visuals per post.\r\n\r\nBut page load speed and blog post images don\u2019t have to be enemies. \r\n\r\nIn fact, a simple drag-and-drop into an image compression software can often reduce the file size of your blog images by 50\u201380% each (while still maintaining image quality).\r\n\r\n<video autoplay muted loop controls src=\"\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/10\/image-compression-in-action.mp4\"><\/video>\r\n\r\nUse the list below as your guide and compress each of your images so that they fall underneath these metrics:\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>In-Post Images: Under 250kb<\/li>\r\n<li>Infographics: Under 1.5mb<\/li>\r\n<li>PDFs\/Printables: Under 1mb<\/li>\r\n<li>Animations\/Animated GIFs: Under 1.5mb<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n\r\nIf you need a recommendation, I have found three great image compression tools that I use every day. Not only are they easy to use \u2014 they\u2019re 100% free:\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/tinypng.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">TinyPNG<\/a> makes it as easy as dragging and dropping.<\/li>\r\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/imagecompressor.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Optimizilla<\/a> includes a slider to adjust image quality.<\/li>\r\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/imageoptim.com\/mac\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">ImageOptim<\/a> has a desktop app, convenient for offline use.<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n\r\n<h2>11. Implement a Lazy Loader<\/h2>\r\nA lazy loader is an HTML tag or plugin that prioritizes copy first so that your page loads seamlessly \u2014 especially if your blog post requires a lot of video, audio, or imagery.\r\n\r\nWhy is this important? \r\n\r\nLoading heavier files last means your page prioritizes the copy, which looks <i>great<\/i> in the eyes of search engines. \r\n\r\nAdditionally, without loading delays from images, your blog page is going to show content almost instantaneously. \r\n\r\nThis is imperative, considering that a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.thinkwithgoogle.com\/marketing-strategies\/app-and-mobile\/mobile-page-speed-new-industry-benchmarks\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Think With Google study<\/a> shows that more than half of your audience will leave if the site doesn\u2019t load in three seconds.\r\n\r\nGood news \u2014 if you\u2019re using WordPress, you\u2019ll find that they automatically apply a lazy loader to images with height and width attributes, but this feature is currently only available for images.\r\n\r\nIf you want the ability to apply this feature to more than just images \u2014 or maybe you\u2019d like the ability to fine tune the controls \u2014 you\u2019ll have to consider third party plugins. \r\n\r\n<a href= \"https:\/\/blog.hubspot.com\/website\/top-free-lazy-load-image-plugins\u201d target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Hubspot<\/a> curated a great article full of free and paid alternatives.\r\n\r\n<h2>12.

We\u2019ve experimented with about every type of content imaginable and have had great success; however, it didn't come without a good deal of trial and error. \r\n\r\nBut with links and brand mentions from top-tier publications like Fast Company, Thrillist, and Time, we can confidently say we\u2019ve figured out how to do digital PR well.\r\n\r\nKeep reading as we explore digital PR at a conceptual level, the best performing frameworks for digital PR, and 15 digital PR examples that compelled audiences. \r\n\r\n<h2>What Is Digital PR?<\/h2> \r\nDigital PR is a tactical approach for brand building done through <a href=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/creation\/content-creation\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">content creation<\/a>. \r\n\r\nWhen done successfully, a digital PR campaign will result in links and brand mentions from high DA sites, thus increasing authority in the eyes of search engines and real human readers. \r\n\r\nBecause of the organic search and <a href=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/marketing\/link-building-strategies\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">link building implications<\/a>, digital PR is incredibly valuable in SEO right now, but it has larger benefits for brand-building.  \r\n\r\nSure, high DA links will lead to better rankings that you can report on, but what about getting your brand mentioned in major media outlets that thousands of people read every day? \r\n\r\nConsider <a href=\"https:\/\/developers.google.com\/search\/blog\/2022\/08\/helpful-content-update\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Google\u2019s Helpful Content update<\/a>, which explicitly states that \u201cpeople-first content creators focus first on creating satisfying content, while also utilizing SEO best practices to bring searchers additional value.\u201d \r\n\r\nUpdates like this are part of Google\u2019s ongoing mission to reward valuable, people-first content. \r\n\r\nAs a result, brands and <a href=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/creation\/content-creator\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">content creators<\/a> need to think deeply about what their expertise is, who their audience is, and the different ways they can provide value to their audience through content. This takes a little creativity. \r\n<h2>Successful Frameworks for Digital PR<\/h2>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/10\/successful-framework-for-digital-PR.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1401\" height=\"1331\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-30115\" \/>\r\n\r\nTraditional blog posts aren\u2019t out of style, but in digital PR, quality copy is oftentimes best served when paired with another framework. \r\n\r\nThere are a few frameworks that have historically performed well in digital PR. These include:\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Interactives<\/li> \r\n<li>Data studies<\/li>  \r\n<li>Maps and city studies<\/li>  \r\n<li>Surveys<\/li>  \r\n<li>Current events content<\/li>   \r\n<\/ul>\r\n\r\nThese are broad categories that can be combined and broken down into different subsects of each other. \r\n\r\nStay with us as we explore 15 examples of these frameworks in practice and the profound impact they had on brand development.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/marketing\/digital-pr-cost\"><img src=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/07\/cost-of-digital-pr-cta-1.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1401\" height=\"518\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-29099\" \/><\/a>\r\n \r\n<h2>15 Top-Tier Digital PR Examples<\/h2>  \r\nGaining digital PR traction starts with creating world-class <a href=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/marketing\/creative-content\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">creative content<\/a>. \r\n\r\nThe examples below exemplify the best of the best in content and digital PR \u2014 with the links to back it up. Let\u2019s dive in. \r\n<h2>Interactives<\/h2>   \r\n\u201cInteractives\u201d is an umbrella term in content marketing that includes everything ranging from calculators to clickable charts, quizzes, and more. \r\n\r\n<a href=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/creation\/interactive-content\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Interactive content<\/a> elevates topics and adds a level of value that traditional blog content can\u2019t, along with having long-term passive link value. See some top-tier examples below. \r\n\r\n<h3>1. Car Affordability Calculator by The Zebra<\/h3> \r\n\r\n<img src=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/how-much-car-the-zebra.gif\" alt=\"\" width=\"1920\" height=\"1080\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-28578\" \/>\r\n\r\nSomeone searching \u201cwhat car can I afford with my salary\u201d doesn\u2019t want to see a list of considerations; they want to see a number. \r\n\r\nThis in-depth and multi-faceted <a href=\"https:\/\/www.thezebra.com\/resources\/driving\/how-much-car-can-i-afford\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">car affordability calculator<\/a> by <a href=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/work\/insurance-content-marketing\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">The Zebra<\/a> shows that you can take a SEO post for a keyword like \u201cwhat car can i afford with my salary,\u201d and elevate it to fit user intent. \r\n\r\nWith 77 links and counting, the content\u2019s success illustrates the importance of user intent. \r\n\r\nIf you were choosing between a copy-only piece and copy + calculator, which would you choose?\r\n\r\n<h3>2. Baby Name Generator by Shutterfly<\/h3> \r\n\r\n<img src=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/10\/baby-name-generator-1.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1400\" height=\"1046\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-30174\" \/>\r\n\r\nThis <a href=\"https:\/\/www.shutterfly.com\/ideas\/baby-name-generator\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">baby name generator<\/a> by Shutterfly is another example of using interactives to go above and beyond to meet audience intent. \r\n\r\nWhile many sites will just include a list of typical baby names, this generator tailors a name specifically for you. The generator first asks if you\u2019d like to see a male, female, or neutral name. Then, it lets you elect a \u201cname style\u201d (celebrity, vintage, biblical, etc). \r\n\r\nBecause of these features, users can have a more personalized and rewarding experience. \r\n\r\n<h3>3. Jetflix Vacations by mybaggage<\/h3> \r\n\r\n<img src=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/10\/jetflix-vacations.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1400\" height=\"645\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-30109\" \/>\r\n\r\nThis piece of content by mybaggage is a favorite of ours because it takes a familiar theme (browsing for a show) and applies it to a popular search theme (browsing for a vacation). \r\n\r\nMany people want to travel for the sake of traveling, so why not let your streaming taste dictate your next adventure? \r\n\r\nTitled <a href=\"https:\/\/www.mybaggage.com\/blog\/jetflix-vacations\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">\u201dJetflix Vacations\u201d<\/a> the quiz polls you on your favorite genres, your desired mood when watching T.V., what type of vacation you\u2019re looking for, and what season you want to travel during. \r\n\r\nThe results display a location based on a show you\u2019re assumed to enjoy.\r\n\r\nAs a result, you\u2019re not only getting a vacation recommendation; you may find a new show to binge as well. \r\n\r\n<h2>Data Studies<\/h2>   \r\nData studies are perhaps the most effective way of getting high DA links because they give your content an added layer of trust. \r\n\r\nAdditionally, when it comes to pitching to journalists, providing original data about a niche they cover gives you a far better chance of landing a brand mention and link. \r\n\r\nLet\u2019s explore some examples. \r\n\r\n<h3>4. Startup Statistics by Embroker<\/h3> \r\n\r\n<img src=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/10\/startup-statistics-1.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1400\" height=\"1001\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-30173\" \/>\r\n\r\nThis data study on <a href=\"https:\/\/www.embroker.com\/blog\/startup-statistics\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">startup statistics<\/a> by <a href=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/work\/startup-content-marketing\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Embroker<\/a> does an excellent job of blending data-driven storytelling with unique visuals to create something that encompasses the best of both worlds. \r\n\r\nThe post rounds up 106 startup statistics in a digestible format and offers a glimpse into the world of startups through raw data.\r\n\r\nThe post has racked up over 1,000 links, including Business Insider, TechCrunch, and Investopedia. \r\n\r\n<h3>5. Emoji Marketing by CleverTap<\/h3> \r\n\r\n<img src=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/10\/emoji-marketing.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1401\" height=\"725\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-30107\" \/>\r\n\r\n<a href=\"https:\/\/clevertap.com\/blog\/emoji-marketing\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">This data study<\/a> by <a href=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/work\/mobile-saas-content-marketing\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">CleverTap<\/a>, a customer engagement platform, compares marketing metrics in campaigns that include emojis v.s. those that don\u2019t.\r\n\r\nEmoji marketing is relatively self-explanatory as a concept. Users were more interested in knowing if the concept works in practice.\r\n\r\nSomeone searching this term is likely a marketer looking to gain actionable insights about emoji marketing. Raw data is truly the one way to fulfill this request. \r\n\r\n<h3>6. Women in Healthcare by Mckinsey<\/h3> \r\n\r\n<img src=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/10\/women-in-healthcare-statistics.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1401\" height=\"808\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-30116\" \/>\r\n\r\nWe\u2019re big fans of this McKinsey study on <a href=\"https:\/\/www.mckinsey.com\/industries\/healthcare-systems-and-services\/our-insights\/women-in-the-healthcare-industry\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">women in healthcare<\/a> because it uses data to tell a compelling and timely story. \r\n\r\nThe question, as stated by the author in the first paragraph, is \u201cHow does the healthcare sector stack up on gender equality?\u201d \r\n\r\nIt\u2019s an incredibly important question that deserves only the most thoughtful and accurate answer. \r\n\r\nData is able to accomplish more than copy to address this issue. \r\n\r\n<h2>Maps and City Studies<\/h2>\r\nOne of the best methods for gaining local coverage is through city studies and interactive maps.\r\n\r\nComparing data by cities and states is extremely useful for local journalists, who are constantly looking for their next story. If a journalist cites and links to your study in their article, they gain extra value for their piece. In return, you gain a high-quality link and brand mention. \r\n\r\n<blockquote class=\"definition\"><strong>Pro tip:<\/strong> When pitching city studies to journalists, go ahead and lay out the angle for the story during the pitch process. If you give them a story from the get-go, it makes their job much easier.<\/blockquote>\r\n\r\n<h3>7. Best Cities for Young Adults by Homebuyer<\/h3> \r\n\r\n<img src=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/10\/best-cities-for-young-adults.gif\" alt=\"\" width=\"1400\" height=\"1000\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-30104\" \/>\r\n\r\nThis <a href=\"https:\/\/homebuyer.com\/learn\/best-cities-for-millennials-2021\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">millenial map<\/a> by <a href=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/work\/homebuyer-content-marketing\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Homebuyer<\/a> uses an interactive map to tell a data-driven story about what young adults value in a city. \r\n\r\nConsidering jobs, commutes, populations, and food and drink establishments, Homebuyer was able to build a list that ranks and scores the 12 best cities for young adults to move to. \r\n\r\nUsing this format, they were able to appeal to publications at the local and national levels. \r\n\r\nThe piece has over 60 links and was mentioned by a national publication, CNBC,  as well as a local one, ABC11, a Durham, North Carolina news station.\r\n\r\n<h3>8. Pet Ownership Statistics by State by World Population Review<\/h3> \r\n\r\n<img src=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/10\/pet-ownership-statistics.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1401\" height=\"1054\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-30112\" \/>\r\n\r\nThis <a href=\"https:\/\/worldpopulationreview.com\/state-rankings\/pet-ownership-statistics-by-state\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">pet ownership statistics<\/a> map by the World Population Review is memorable because of its interactive element. \r\n\r\nWhen you click on a state, you get a snapshot of the percentage of the state population that owns a pet, and how that percentage breaks down into dog owners and cat owners.\r\n\r\nThere\u2019s a ton of data in this piece, but it doesn\u2019t overwhelm. Because of its interactive element, the map can deliver the exact amount of information that the user wants to see. As a result, it appears simple, but is still incredibly detailed and effective. \r\n\r\n<h3>9. Nursing Shortage Map by USAHS<\/h3> \r\n\r\n<img src=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/10\/nursing-shortage-map.gif\" alt=\"\" width=\"1400\" height=\"1227\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-30172\" \/>\r\n\r\nThis <a href=\"https:\/\/www.usa.edu\/blog\/nursing-shortage\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">nursing shortage map<\/a> by the <a href=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/work\/university-content-marketing\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">University of St. Augustine for Health Sciences<\/a> (USHS) allows users to hover over each state and see the number of registered nurses in that state in 2020, the state population, and the number of nurses per 1,000 state residents. \r\n\r\nThe story here is that the U.S. has a nursing shortage and it\u2019s affecting certain states more than others. By visualizing the states in different shades and adding interactivity to the map, USHS illustrates the issue in a way that anyone can understand. \r\n\r\n<h2>Surveys<\/h2>  \r\nStaying on the topic of data, surveys add value to topics because the data is wholly unique. \r\n\r\nTraditional data studies and city studies typically pull data from online resources and use the numbers to tell their story. \r\n\r\nWith surveys, you control the data from start to finish \u2014 giving you an automatic edge over competitors when pitching to the media. \r\n\r\n<h3>10. Household Chores Survey by Angi<\/h3> \r\n\r\n<img src=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/10\/household-chores-survey.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1401\" height=\"862\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-30108\" \/>\r\n\r\nThis <a href=\"https:\/\/www.angi.com\/articles\/household-chores-survey.htm\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">household chores survey<\/a> by Angi gives perspective on how much time Americans spend in their lives doing chores (Spolier: It\u2019s a year).\r\n\r\nThis particular survey offers that \u201cwow\u201d factor that a content creator hopes for when using original data. The \u201cwow\u201d is that Americans spend a year of their life doing chores \u2014 but it's not the whole story. \r\n\r\nThe survey tells a larger story about homeowners v.s. renters and the role that gender plays in doing chores. Angi does a great job of getting users through the door with a compelling headline and then leading them through the larger idea. \r\n\r\n<h3>11. Spending Knowledge Survey by Mint<\/h3> \r\n\r\n<img src=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/10\/spending-knowledge-survey.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1401\" height=\"851\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-30113\" \/>\r\n\r\nThis <a href=\"https:\/\/mint.intuit.com\/blog\/budgeting\/spending-knowledge-survey\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">spending knowledge survey<\/a> by Mint works well to highlight the fact that most Americans are unaware of how much they spend on a monthly basis. \r\n\r\nThis survey has gained well over 300 links and counting since it was published in 2020, including references by CNBC, Yahoo News, and American Express.\r\n\r\nThe reason being? It answers an important question without speculation. <a href=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/seo\/ymyl\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">YMYL content<\/a> is very important to users, so it\u2019s crucial brands get it right. Additionally, it\u2019s relatable. Users enjoy seeing data they can place themselves in and see how they compare to others. \r\n\r\n<h3>12.

What qualifies as \u201cbest\u201d and how can anyone claim to be an authority on this topic? \r\n\r\nThe answer: Original data. And a LOT of it. In order to do this well, a large sample size was pivotal. By polling over 20,000 people worldwide, TimeOut was able to claim authority on the subject. \r\n\r\n<h2>Current Events Content<\/h2> \r\nCapitalizing on what\u2019s currently relevant is an effective way to gain mentions in high DA publications.\r\n\r\nThis could range from pop culture to upcoming holidays, political elections, social media trends, and more. Let\u2019s explore.  \r\n\r\n<h3>13. Wordle Wizards by Wordtips<\/h3> \r\n\r\n<img src=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/10\/wordle-wizards.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1401\" height=\"1264\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-30117\" \/>\r\n\r\nThe game Wordle took the world by storm in 2022, and brands were quick to capitalize on its popularity.\r\n\r\nThis <a href=\"https:\/\/word.tips\/wordle-wizards\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Wordle Wizards map<\/a> by Wordtips analyzed Twitter data to determine what global city was best at solving the daily Wordle, as well as what countries and U.S. states reigned supreme. \r\n\r\nThe results? Over 400 links since January. \r\n\r\nWhy? Because it elevates a topic everyone is already infatuated with. We love Wordle; why wouldn\u2019t we want to know what countries are best at it? \r\n\r\n<h3>14. National Ros\u00e9 Day Cocktails by Winc<\/h3> \r\n\r\n<img src=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/10\/national-rose-day-recipes.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1401\" height=\"1226\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-30111\" \/>\r\n\r\nCapitalizing on holidays, a.k.a seasonal content, is a must for brands, and Winc does this especially well with their piece on <a href=\"https:\/\/www.winc.com\/blog\/festive-cocktails-for-national-ros--day\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">festive cocktails for national ros\u00e9 day<\/a>. \r\n\r\nThe content offers recipes for a number of different ros\u00e9-based cocktails that users can try out. \r\n\r\nThe best part about this content is that it's recyclable and can drive <a href=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/strategy\/evergreen-content\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">evergreen results<\/a> if refreshed annually. Once you create it for the first time, you can tweak it and republish it every year, making it a link building engine that never breaks down.\r\n\r\n<h3> 15.

As a leader in reservation making, OpenTable has an infinite number of restaurant reviews at their disposal that they can parse through to make this guide. \r\n\r\nHowever, this doesn\u2019t change the fact that this is a great use of resources. By using this information and using it well, OpenTable continues to be the go-to for this information year after year.  \r\n\r\n<h2>Essential Digital PR Tools<\/h2>\r\nYou know what success looks like in the digital PR realm, now it\u2019s time to put your plan into action.\r\n\r\nLuckily, there are a number of resources to help you get started \u2014 and a good chunk of them are free. \r\n\r\nHere are a few great resources for the different types of content. \r\n\r\n<h3>For Data<\/h3> \r\nYou don\u2019t need a fancy tool to get data.

    "content": "We know what you\u2019re thinking: \u201cSiege, how can you tell me not to do off-page SEO? Haven\u2019t you sent over <strong>1 million<\/strong> emails for the purpose of link building?\u201d\r\n\r\nYes, we have, and we will continue to do so in the right circumstances. \r\n\r\nWhat we\u2019ve found with <a href=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/marketing\/manual-link-building\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">manual link building<\/a> and other off-page SEO initiatives is that, sometimes, the effort isn\u2019t worth the return and can take time away from other more impactful optimizations.\r\n\r\nIn this post, we\u2019ll help you answer whether off-page SEO  is right for you. \r\n\r\n<strong>We\u2019ll be covering:<\/strong>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><a href=\"#what-is\">What Is Off-page SEO?<\/a><\/li>\r\n<li><a href=\"#off-page-vs-on-page\">Off-Page SEO vs. On-Page SEO<\/a><\/li>\r\n<li><a href=\"#link-building\">Link Building<\/a><\/li>\r\n<li><a href=\"#local-seo\">Local SEO<\/a><\/li>\r\n<li><a href=\"#reputation-mgmt\">Reputation Management<\/a><\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n\r\n<h2 id=\"what-is\">What Is Off-Page SEO?<\/h2>\r\nOff-page SEO consists of any optimizations that take place outside of making change directly on your site. \r\n\r\nThese optimizations include local citations, strategic link building, and more. \r\n\r\nUltimately, the point of off-page SEO is to establish a more trusted and authoritative presence in the eyes of both users <i>and<\/i> search engines.\r\n\r\n<h2 id=\"off-page-vs-on-page\">Off-Page SEO vs. On-Page SEO<\/h2>\r\nBefore we get into off-page SEO strategy, let\u2019s quickly discuss the difference between off-page and <a href=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/strategy\/on-page-seo\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">on-page SEO<\/a>.\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/09\/off-page-seo-vs-on-page-seo.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"2801\" height=\"1821\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-30088\" \/>\r\n\r\nThe distinction is in their names. \r\n\r\nOn-page SEO involves every optimization on your site that could impact rankings. \r\n\r\nThis includes site architecture and hierarchy, <a href=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/seo\/content-strategy\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">content strategy<\/a>, image optimization, sitemaps, internal links, structured markup, and more. \r\n\r\nAgain, all off-page SEO optimizations take place <i>off<\/i> of your website. \r\n\r\nThis could look like fixing broken backlinks, updating Google My Business information, and social media content.\r\n\r\n<h2>Off-Page SEO Techniques<\/h2>\r\nWhile there are many different types of off-page SEO, we\u2019ve broken them down into three main groups to help walk you through which will best benefit you.\r\n\r\nTraditional off-page SEO techniques include:\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><strong>Link building:<\/strong> Improves the overall backlink profile of your site.<\/li>\r\n<li><strong>Local SEO:<\/strong>  Optimizes your site to be more visible for local search results, such as map results or results pages for location specific keywords.<\/li>\r\n<li><strong>Reputation management:<\/strong> Improves how people see your brand.<\/li>\r\n\r\n<h3 id=\"link-building\">Link Building<\/h3>\r\n<a href=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/seo\/what-is-link-building\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Link Building<\/a> consists of any effort made to obtain more backlinks, which are links from other websites that direct users back to your website. \r\n\r\nSearch engines treat these as signals of authority as they act as a website-form of a referral, pointing back to your content as a source. \r\n\r\nThe reason that backlinks are pivotal is because they are direct ranking factors. \r\n\r\nHaving a backlink profile full of high-authority referring domains \u2014 sites that search engines see as trustworthy \u2014 will help to improve rankings on the SERP.\r\n\r\nIt\u2019s important to note that backlinks are measured on a quality-over-quantity basis. The old saying, \u201cIt\u2019s better to have four quarters than 100 pennies,\u201d very much applies here. \r\n\r\nIn this context, it\u2019s better to have a fewer number of <a href=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/marketing\/link-relevancy\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">relevant referring domains<\/a> and\/or domains with higher authority than a larger quantity of backlinks that aren\u2019t relevant or have a lower domain rating (DR).\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/09\/link-building-types.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1401\" height=\"1288\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-30056\" \/>\r\n\r\nNow that we covered what link building is, let\u2019s break down how to generate them: \r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><strong>Passive link building:<\/strong> Acquiring links without any sort of outreach. Siege believes this to be the most ideal way to obtain links and we recommend doing this through <a href=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/creation\/content-creation\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">content creation<\/a>.<\/li>\r\n\r\n<blockquote class=\"definition\">\r\nClick  <a href=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/marketing\/manual-link-building\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">here<\/a> to read more about Siege\u2019s change in focus from manual outreach to passive link building.<\/blockquote>\r\n\r\n<li><strong>Manual link building:<\/strong> Reaching out to partners, sponsors, news outlets, vendors, customers and other platforms to ask for backlinks.<\/li>\r\n<li><strong>Broken link building:<\/strong> Updating backlinks that are pointing to 404 pages on your site to functional pages on your site.<\/li>\r\n<li><strong>Link reclamation:<\/strong> <a href=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/marketing\/advanced-link-reclamation\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Reclaiming backlinks<\/a> that were lost or unlinked by its host site.<\/li>\r\n<li><strong>Self-created links:<\/strong>  Creating links by adding entries into directories or forums (ex. Better Business Bureau, YellowPages, Crunchbase).<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n\r\n<h4>Who Is Link Building Right For?<\/h4>\r\nWhile <a href=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/marketing\/how-to-get-backlinks\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">backlinks<\/a> are a ranking factor, before deciding to include link building in your SEO strategy, consider the following:\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Outreach takes a significant amount of time to perform. Sadly, each of the above techniques (aside from passive link building) all involve some sort of outreach.<\/li>\r\n<li>Outreach <i>does not<\/i> guarantee backlinks. You could receive 40 backlinks from 50 emails you send, or you could receive a single backlink from 100 emails.<\/li>\r\n<li>If you have a high domain rating, it may make sense to prioritize other <a href=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/strategy\/on-page-seo\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">on-page SEO optimizations<\/a>, like content optimizations, technical fixes, site architecture, and page speed optimizations.\r\n<\/ul>\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, passive link building is in a slightly different category. If you\u2019re already focusing on content creation, here some more considerations:\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Creating a <a href=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/seo\/post-structure-for-seo\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">sound post structure<\/a> and utilizing <a href=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/seo\/blog-best-practices-seo\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">blog design best practices<\/a> for your content that prioritizes low-difficulty topics can help to obtain links without any outreach at all.<\/li>\r\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/creation\/interactive-content\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Interactive content<\/a> such as calculators, customized tools, and statistics are great ways to passively build links.<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n\r\nAll that said, we are certainly not saying that manual link building does not have any value. \r\n\r\nHere are a few instances where including manual link building in an SEO strategy would be beneficial:\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Businesses with low DR sites reaching out to partners, current and previous customers, or news outlets for links.<\/li>\r\n<li>Local businesses that create entries in directories such as Yellow Pages or other entities like the Better Business Bureau.<\/li>\r\n<li>Turning unlinked brand mentions into links in high authority publications. For example, if you find that the New York Times or Forbes mentions your company, product or service, it\u2019s definitely worth it to reach out and request a link.<\/li>\r\n<li>Sites that have lost a significant amount of existing links to broken pages, pages that don\u2019t exist anymore on your site, or pages on other sites that frequently change.<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/09\/include-link-building-in-your-seo-strategy.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1401\" height=\"1676\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-30055\" \/>\r\n\r\n<h3 id=\"local-seo\">Local SEO<\/h3>\r\nLocal SEO optimizations are anything that helps to improve a site\u2019s rank for local search results.\r\n\r\nThis optimization is essential for any brick-and-mortar business or company that operates in a certain area, such as a chain of auto repair shops in southwest Massachusetts or Tex-Mex restaurants in Austin, Texas.\r\n\r\nLocal SEO optimizations include (but are not limited to):\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Creating and maintaining a Google My Business listing<\/li>\r\n<li>Ensure third-party citations are accurate and consistent<\/li>\r\n\r\n<blockquote class=\"definition\">Third-party citations are commonly known as your business's <strong>NAP<\/strong> \u2014 name, address, and phone number.<\/blockquote>\r\n\r\n<li>Claiming listings on popular user-generated content sites<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n\r\n<h4>Who Is Local SEO Right For?<\/h4>\r\nIf you are one of the following business, we\u2019d strongly recommend including local off-page SEO optimizations in your strategy in some way:\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Small, independent, or family-owned businesses that operate out of one to three locations (this includes but is not limited to restaurants, boutiques, automotive repair shops, and legal practices)<\/li>\r\n<li>Trade-related businesses (electricians, plumbers)<\/li>\r\n<li>Medium to large businesses with brick-and-mortar stores (Autozone, Whole Foods, Best Buy)<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n\r\nIf you\u2019re a part of a larger, enterprise-level corporation or e-commerce company like Microsoft, Amazon, or Boeing, you wouldn\u2019t benefit as much from local search optimizations.\r\n\r\nYou\u2019d be much better off putting your time and effort elsewhere \u2014 content, page speed, or structured markup optimizations to name a few \u2014 where you could more effectively move the needle in terms of traffic and rankings.\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/09\/do-local-seo.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1401\" height=\"1056\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-30054\" \/>\r\n\r\n<h3 id=\"reputation-mgmt\">Reputation Management<\/h3>\r\nReputation management consists of any off-site activities that help to improve the public perception of your brand. \r\n\r\nThis can include <a href=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/marketing\/what-is-digital-pr\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">digital PR<\/a>, social media marketing, managing reviews, and even influencer marketing. \r\n\r\n<h4>Who Is Reputation Management Right For?<\/h4>\r\nReputation management, like the other aspects of off-page SEO we\u2019ve discussed so far, is based on several factors. We\u2019d recommend putting effort into this as needed.\r\n\r\n<strong>Social Media Presence<\/strong>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Smaller, independent businesses may benefit by creating more brand awareness \u2014 helping attract customers by increasing the overall click-through rate to their site.<\/li>\r\n<li>Larger manufacturers or construction companies may benefit from prioritizing other website optimization.<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n<strong>Service and Product-Based Reviews<\/strong>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Larger companies would benefit from responding to reviews from Google since these reviews contribute to how search engines evaluate a site\u2019s authority and, in turn, help to improve rankings.\r\n<\/ul>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/09\/prioritize-reputation-management.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1401\" height=\"1771\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-30058\" \/>\r\n\r\n<h2>Off-Page SEO Can Be Valuable, Just Not for Everyone<\/h2>\r\nIf you\u2019ve gotten this far, we\u2019re sure you\u2019ve noticed a pattern here: prioritization. \r\n\r\nOff-page SEO is still an incredibly valuable tool that can help <a href=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/strategy\/increase-website-traffic\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">get more traffic to your site<\/a> and boost your rankings. \r\n\r\nHowever, many of the aspects of off-page SEO are not direct ranking factors and are beneficial only in certain situations.\r\n\r\nIf you\u2019re having trouble evaluating if your site needs off-page SEO or want to improve your site\u2019s overall organic performance, Siege Media is well equipped to help.\r\n\r\nOur <a href=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/services\/seo\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">SEO consulting services<\/a> don\u2019t just focus on one-off tactics, but on comprehensive strategies that will make a real impact on your business.

    "title": "DEI in Marketing: 10+ Ways to Make Content More Inclusive",
    "content": "DEI is more than a buzzword \u2014 it's a mindset.\r\n\r\nDiversity, equity, and inclusion is at the forefront of business conversations just about everywhere. We as marketers, regardless of industry, have an interesting role: We must acknowledge these conversations from not only a brand perspective but also the audience's. \r\n\r\nIn fact, since an overwhelming majority (70%) of audiences respond positively to <a href=\"https:\/\/advertiseonbing-blob.azureedge.net\/blob\/bingads\/media\/insight\/whitepapers\/2020\/07-july\/inclusive-marketing\/microsoft-advertising-whitepaper-the-psychology-of-inclusion-and-the-effects-in-advertising-gen-z-final.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">DEI in marketing<\/a>, rising to the occasion only helps your brand in the long run (more on that later).\r\n\r\nA tall order, to be sure \u2014 and one that I, Siege's resident Sensitivity Editor, am afraid to say is impossible to be executed perfectly. \r\n\r\nThat's not to say you will always fall short \u2014 rather, there's no such thing as \"perfect\" at all. Awareness, empathy, and compassion aren't exactly quantifiable metrics or one-and-done to-dos on a checklist. \r\n\r\nDEI in marketing boils down to one simple but immeasurable idea: All we can do is try our best.\r\n\r\nThe good news is that trying your best starts with simply learning more. Leveling up your own understanding in turn levels up your content, which can translate to more authentic connections with your audience, <a href=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/services\/link-building\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">more links<\/a> with high-quality prospects, and <a href=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/seo\/what-is-eat\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">better E-A-T<\/a>. \r\n\r\nIf you're reading this, chances are you're open to learning with us. Join us as we explore why DEI in marketing is important, along with 11 ways we can try our best in both our content marketing and our daily lives.\r\n\r\n<h2>What Is DEI?<\/h2>\r\nAt its core, <strong>diversity, equity, and inclusion<\/strong> in marketing is all about representing, elevating, and welcoming different identities through content.\r\n\r\n<h3>Diversity<\/h3>\r\n<strong>Diversity<\/strong> refers to the variety of identities and backgrounds represented in a given space (or piece of content).\r\n\r\nIdentities and backgrounds can refer to race, ethnicity, gender identity, age, national and regional origin, religion, disability, neurodivergence, sexuality and relationship status, socioeconomic position, education, marital status, language, veteran status, physical appearance, political ideology, life experiences\u2026.\r\n\r\nYou get the idea: Everyone is different, and diversity aims to represent as many of these differences as possible.\r\n\r\n<h3>Equity<\/h3>\r\nA bit more of an intentional process than diversity, <strong>equity<\/strong> means providing everyone with equal opportunities AND equal access to them. \r\n\r\nThis means we must acknowledge and help eliminate barriers that may block some of us from those opportunities.\r\n\r\nTo be equitable in marketing often means considering different accessibility needs (which we'll get to later).\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/08\/equality-vs-equity.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1401\" height=\"469\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-29628\" \/>\r\n\r\n<h3>Inclusion<\/h3>\r\nMeanwhile, <strong>inclusion<\/strong> extends beyond representation to foster a fair, welcoming, respectful, and collaborative environment.\r\n\r\nIt's not enough to simply include visibly different people in your content \u2014 you must also consider, embrace, and respect where those different people come from and what they seek from your content.\r\n\r\nAnd no, you don't have to craft your content for every internet user on the planet; you just want to be sensitive to and inclusive of your target audience \u2014 but more on that later.\r\n\r\n<h2>What Does This Mean for Marketing?<\/h2>\r\nMarketing exists at the unique intersection of reflecting real life and shaping it. \r\n\r\nDEI in marketing accomplishes both: It shows that you're aware of the different backgrounds that comprise our world while actively celebrating and solidifying that fact.\r\n\r\nYou'd be hard-pressed to find someone who doesn't agree that DEI is the future of marketing.\r\n\r\nI'd argue it's already our present, as well \u2014 after all, our audience already expects us to meet them there.\r\n\r\n<h2>Why Does It Matter?<\/h2>\r\nDEI in marketing is important because it tells your audience you see them, you hear them, and you're responding to them. But that's not the only reason it should be important to you.\r\n\r\n<h3>It Matters to Your Audience<\/h3>\r\nObviously, we have to market TO someone. In doing so, we often ask ourselves, \"What does our audience want from our content?\"\r\n\r\nSpoiler alert: Your audience wants to see themselves represented in your content and walk away feeling that it was made with them in mind.\r\n\r\nFor example, 71% of the LGBTQ+ community are <a href=\"https:\/\/www.thinkwithgoogle.com\/future-of-marketing\/management-and-culture\/diversity-and-inclusion\/thought-leadership-marketing-diversity-inclusion\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">more likely to interact<\/a> with online content that represents their sexuality in an authentic way. \r\n\r\nWe can pretty much guarantee that your audience is composed of a myriad of different backgrounds and experiences.\r\n\r\nIt's important not to alienate them with content that ignores their differences. \r\n\r\n<img src=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/08\/LGBTQ-community-online-interaction-stat.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1401\" height=\"686\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-29629\" \/>\r\n\r\nMore than that, audiences value diverse and inclusive content in general: <a href=\"https:\/\/business.adobe.com\/blog\/the-latest\/despite-25-years-of-advertising-growth-diversity-remains-a-challenge#gs.17qt9f\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">65%<\/a> of consumers across the globe consider diversity in marketing to be important. \r\n\r\nBeing sensitive in your content demonstrates to your audience that you respect their values.\r\n\r\n<h3>It Matters to Your Bottom Line<\/h3>\r\nIn something of a self-fulfilling prophecy, catering to these audience expectations helps your rankings and your brand. \r\n\r\nRemember that while we may write for Google, we also write for real people. Those real people, including 78% of women and people of color, trust brands that they <a href=\"https:\/\/advertiseonbing-blob.azureedge.net\/blob\/bingads\/media\/insight\/whitepapers\/2020\/07-july\/inclusive-marketing\/microsoft-advertising-whitepaper-the-psychology-of-inclusion-and-the-effects-in-advertising-gen-z-final.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">perceive as authentic<\/a> in their marketing efforts.\r\n\r\nThe more you keep DEI in mind with your content, the more natural and authentic it will be.\r\n\r\nReaders can tell if a given piece of content is ignorant of the industry, keyword topic, or audience (and is thus not diverse or inclusive enough). And the fewer readers you're capturing, the fewer clicks you're going to receive \u2014 not to mention the fewer <a href=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/seo\/what-is-link-building\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">links you'll build<\/a>.\r\n\r\nDiversity and inclusion can <a href=\"https:\/\/hbr.org\/2018\/01\/how-and-where-diversity-drives-financial-performance\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">bolster innovation revenue<\/a> by almost 13%. By demonstrating compassion and authenticity, you bring more value to your content and, in turn, your site.\r\n\r\n<h3>It Matters, Period<\/h3>\r\nAllow us to get on a soapbox here: In 2022, prioritizing DEI in marketing is just the right thing to do. \r\n\r\nRecognizing and embracing our differences can only help make the world a better place. \r\n\r\n<h2>11 Ways to Make Your Content More Inclusive<\/h2>\r\nI mentioned earlier that, like many aspects of what we do, DEI in marketing is <a href=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/seo\/seo-writing\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">asymptotic<\/a> \u2014 that is, no matter how good you are at it, there's no such thing as reaching perfection.\r\n\r\nBut there are countless ways to strive to be better. Here are just a few fundamentals.\r\n\r\n<h3>1. Understand the DEI(&B) Landscape<\/h3>\r\nIt can be helpful to do a little bit of homework on DEI in marketing or in general to get a feel for the current discourse. You're off to a good start with this post!\r\n\r\nAlso consider that while generally the default acronym, \"DEI\" is far from all-encompassing. \r\n\r\nAs conversations continue to evolve, so too does this umbrella term \u2014 in recent years, \"belonging\" has entered the DEI(&B) equation.\r\n\r\n<strong>Belonging<\/strong> is what your audience (hopefully) feels when engaging with your content. It's arguably the hardest idea in the acronym to achieve because your output as a marketer has no control over it. \r\n\r\nOf course, if your audience feels that your content is authentically inclusive, hopefully belonging falls right into place.\r\n\r\n<h3>2. Be Intentional and Willing<\/h3>\r\nFrankly, a majority of the legwork required to be \"good\" at DEI in marketing starts with your own awareness and commitment to trying your best. \r\n\r\nBe willing to:\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><strong>Purposefully shift your mindset.<\/strong> Be intentional about being a good ally.<\/li> \r\n<li><strong>Be uncomfortable.<\/strong> Be open to new information that challenges existing beliefs.<\/li>\r\n<li><strong>Learn and grow.<\/strong> Read, listen, and absorb on a continuous basis, then apply and practice what you learn.<\/li>\r\n<li><strong>Accept feedback.<\/strong> Part of the learning and growing process means being receptive to how your content affects others.<\/li>\r\n<li><strong>Fail.<\/strong> We can't and won't get it right the first time every time. Being a good DEI advocate doesn't mean knowing how to be perfect, but rather knowing how to do better.<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/08\/DEI-advocate.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1401\" height=\"559\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-29627\" \/>\r\n\r\n<h3>3. Recognize Biases and Knowledge Gaps<\/h3>\r\nA little self-reflection never hurt anyone.\r\n\r\nIn line with the first two tips, understand where you fall into the DEI conversation. Recognize <a href=\"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/20363905\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">any implicit biases<\/a> or perspectives you're carrying that may create knowledge gaps and prevent your content from being authentic or inclusive.\r\n\r\nThis works not only on a macro level (contextualizing your DEI efforts), but also on a micro level (for each piece of content you create).\r\n\r\nLet's say you're writing a post about budgeting as a working college student, whereas you were fortunate enough as a student to have your expenses covered without needing a job. \r\n\r\nWell, your perspective likely doesn't reflect that of the broke college student the post is made for, and you won't want to write your post with assumptions that ignore their reality.\r\n\r\nYou'll have to research wages, education expenses, and housing costs to better understand the audience's perspective.\r\n\r\nAgain, you may not know the right answer every time, but you can try to ask yourself (or your search bar) the right questions.\r\n\r\n<h3>4. Always Know Your Audience<\/h3>\r\nOther than keyword research, audience research is content marketing's bread and butter. \r\n\r\nTo be inclusive of your audience, ask yourself:\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Who are they?<\/li>\r\n<li>What are their backgrounds and experiences?<\/li>\r\n<li>Where are they coming from with this search intent?<\/li>\r\n<li>What are they hoping to learn?<\/li>\r\n<li>What existing knowledge do you expect them to come with?<\/li>\r\n<li>Is this keyword or subject matter relevant to them?<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\nCheck SERP data for further insights, too \u2014 what angles, content types, or information converts? Where could you bring more value to the specific audience?\r\n\r\n<strong>Inclusive content in action:<\/strong>\r\nThe Zebra's \"<a href=\"https:\/\/www.thezebra.com\/resources\/personal-finance\/veterans-homebuying-guide\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Homebuying Guide for Veterans<\/a>\" gives valuable information to a specific audience for whom it's relevant.\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/08\/the-zebra.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"700\" height=\"365\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-29694\" \/>\r\n\r\n<h3>5. Never Stop Listening<\/h3>\r\nDEI discourse is everywhere \u2014 everywhere! \u2014 and you can expand your knowledge even passively by simply making mental notes whenever you can.\r\n\r\nAs you peruse <a href=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/creation\/research-backed-content\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">research on Google<\/a>, maybe you encounter a statistic that sheds new light on a topic for you. \r\n\r\nHere's a recent example from my life: While writing this very post, I learned that <a href=\"https:\/\/www.pewresearch.org\/hispanic\/2020\/08\/11\/about-one-in-four-u-s-hispanics-have-heard-of-latinx-but-just-3-use-it\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">only 3%<\/a> of the Hispanic population in the U.S. embraces the term \"Latinx.\"\r\n\r\nI assumed \"Latinx\" had noble intentions in its quest for gender neutrality, but in reality, it's baseless in (if not wholly ignorant of) the Spanish language. Now that I know how the very audience it describes receives this assumption, I've made a mental note to use the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.politico.com\/f\/?id=0000017d-81be-dee4-a5ff-efbe74ec0000\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">more commonly preferred<\/a> \"Hispanic.\"\r\n\r\nAnd this isn't exclusive to info you glean on the clock. As you're scrolling the depths of your For You feed on a TikTok binge, watching TED talks, or even engaging in discussions with friends, listen to, stay curious about, and apply new insights.\r\n\r\n<h3>6. Apply Evolving Language or Knowledge<\/h3>\r\nOK, so what do we actually do with those mental notes?\r\n\r\nThe answer is simple (in theory, anyway): Do your best to incorporate them, both within and outside of content.\r\n\r\nFor example, it may have taken a few years, but we've all largely removed \"gay\" or the R-word from our lexicon of slang by now, which shows that we're capable of evolving with the DEI landscape! \r\n\r\n<strong>Inclusive content in action:<\/strong>\r\nStyleSeat's \"<a href=\"https:\/\/www.styleseat.com\/blog\/how-much-do-dreadlocks-cost\/?utm_source=wordpress&utm_medium=blog&utm_campaign=dreads_cost&utm_content=traditional_locs_cost\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">How Much Do Dreadlocks Cost?<\/a>\" guide shies away from the oft-offensive \"dreads,\" favoring the full \"dreadlocks\" or even \"locs.\"\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/08\/styleseat.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"700\" height=\"589\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-29693\" \/>\r\n\r\n<h3>7. Make Inclusive and Accessible Designs<\/h3>\r\nEvery great example of content marketing involves great UX and great design.\r\n\r\nMake sure your content ticks those boxes in its inclusivity and accessibility, as well.\r\n\r\nThere's no shortage of resources online detailing best practices for creating accessible (i.e., equitable and inclusive) design in your content. We've included a list at the end of this post, but for now, here are a few considerations:\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Include people of color, people with disabilities, and people of different ages in your images.<\/li>\r\n<li>Provide captions or transcripts for audio or video.<\/li>\r\n<li>Use contrasting colors and clear labels for on-screen data visualization.<\/li>\r\n<li>Give detailed descriptions for images through alt text.<\/li>\r\n<li>Avoid animation or video with excessive movement or flashing visuals.<\/li>\r\n<li>Ensure your site is compatible with screen readers, mobile devices, and keyboard navigation.<\/li>\r\n<li>Ensure all content is ADA compliant.<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\nWe recently discovered some research about how <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/RossHudgens\/status\/1560283342825824256?s=20&t=hLOjZRUS2X0wQJFErq8GhQ\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">font can play a role<\/a> in your site's UX accessibility as well \u2014 something to keep in mind as you're creating content.\r\n\r\nSpeaking of, here's a fun fact: We're not necessarily saying you should switch your blogs to Comic Sans, but it does serve a worthy purpose in being accessible for <a href=\"http:\/\/dyslexiahelp.umich.edu\/sites\/default\/files\/good_fonts_for_dyslexia_study.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">readers with dyslexia<\/a>.\r\n\r\n<strong>Inclusive content in action:<\/strong>\r\nThe images in Tommy John's \"<a href=\"https:\/\/www.tommyjohn.com\/blogs\/news\/gymtimidation\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">What Is Gymtimidation and 7 Ways to Overcome It<\/a>\" highlight statistics using both bold copy and visualization and feature people of different ages, genders, and racial backgrounds. \r\n\r\n<img src=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/08\/tommy-john.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"700\" height=\"1079\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-29695\" \/>\r\n\r\n<h3>8. Write With Intention and Compassion<\/h3>\r\nOne of the <a href=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/strategy\/benefits-of-content-marketing\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">benefits of content marketing<\/a> is how much stuff we learn through researching and creating. \r\n\r\nIt's not exactly uncommon for our content to touch on sensitive subjects, such as mental health, disabilities, or even personal finances. \r\n\r\nImagine you're looking for ways to improve your credit score, and you read a post that uses critical, condescending language and even suggests that you're not a trustworthy job candidate if you have a lower score.\r\n\r\nI can already guess how that would make you feel.\r\n\r\nYour content isn't here to judge its readers \u2014 it's here to help them. The little things in your copy can go a long way in creating a welcoming, respectful, and trustworthy environment for your readers.\r\n\r\nHere are a few best practices for every post:\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Ensure your writing is free of biases or stereotypes.<\/li>\r\n<li>Avoid language that insinuates that being white, straight, college-educated, or wealthy is the default.<\/li>\r\n<li>Favor ungendered language (e.g., \"parents\" over \"mom and dad,\" or \"server\" over \"waitress\").<\/li>\r\n<li>Avoid language that perpetuates ableism (the idea that not having a disability is superior or \"normal\").<\/li>\r\n<li>Diversify names of hypothetical people.<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\nWhen it comes to people-first language (\"person with disabilities\") vs. identity-first language (\"disabled person\"), the jury's out on what's preferable. \r\n\r\nThe idea is that people-first language doesn't let the disability (in this example) define or qualify the person \u2014 they are simply a person who has a disability. \r\n\r\nOn the other hand, some audiences do prefer to embrace this part of their identity and not make it an afterthought.\r\n\r\nSince it's unlikely in content marketing that you'll be able to ask your audience how they'd describe themselves, use your best judgment. (If your content follows AP style, <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/APStylebook\/status\/1385690337058959363?s=20&t=e3amdJbCx_H8xZghGR6VOg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">they recommend<\/a> people-first.)\r\n\r\nSomething cool to note is that Google won't penalize you either way \u2014 RetireGuide's \"<a href=\"https:\/\/www.retireguide.com\/retirement-life-leisure\/travel\/disabled-travelers\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">14 Accessible Vacations for Senior Citizens With Limited Mobility<\/a>,\" which uses people-first language, currently ranks fifth for the identity-first keyword \"vacations for disabled seniors\"!\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/08\/retireguide.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"700\" height=\"395\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-29692\" \/>\r\n\r\n<strong>Inclusive content in action:<\/strong>\r\n<a href=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/work\/wedding-content-marketing\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Zola's<\/a> list of \"<a href=\"https:\/\/www.zola.com\/expert-advice\/love-quotes-for-him#:~:text=While%20these%20quotes%20are%20meant%20for%20people%20with%20he\/him%20pronouns%2C%20most%20can%20apply%20to%20any%20type%20of%20romantic%20relationship!\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Best Love Quotes for Him<\/a>\" highlights that while the post is \"meant for people with he\/him pronouns, most can apply to any type of romantic relationship!\" Not only does the copy make a point to be inclusive to everyone, but it also uses inclusive language to get that point across.\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/08\/zola.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"700\" height=\"525\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-29696\" \/>\r\n\r\n<h3>9. Rely on Resources and Continue to Learn<\/h3>\r\nAs I've mentioned, learning and trying your best is a continuous effort. The sites below are excellent resources to help you prioritize DEI in content marketing.\r\n\r\n<strong>For design considerations:<\/strong>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/webaim.org\/resources\/contrastchecker\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Contrast Checker<\/a><\/li>\r\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/contentmarketinginstitute.com\/cco-digital\/october-2019\/accessible-content-marketing\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">A Practical Guide to Content Accessibility<\/a><\/li>\r\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/digital.gov\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Digital.gov<\/a><\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n\r\n<strong>For copy considerations:<\/strong>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/app.allybot.io\/content\/allybot_inclusive_language_guide.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">AllyBot.io\u2019s Inclusive Language Cheat Sheet<\/a> (As an editor from Texas, however, I have to make one small correction: The correct spelling is \"y'all.\")<\/li>\r\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/List_of_disability-related_terms_with_negative_connotations\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Wikipedia\u2019s List of Disability-Related Terms With Negative Connotations<\/a><\/li>\r\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/consciousstyleguide.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">The Conscious Style Guide<\/a> (Also has a newsletter!)<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n\r\nIf your spi-DEI sense starts to tingle, be curious and make it a learning opportunity. If I need a gut check, I often reference <a href=\"https:\/\/www.apstylebook.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">AP Stylebook<\/a> and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.merriam-webster.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Merriam-Webster Dictionary<\/a> for quick, generally-agreed-upon answers.\r\n\r\n<h3>10. Walk the Walk<\/h3>\r\nIn this post we\u2019ve talked a lot about authenticity. There\u2019s no better way for your content to be authentic than to ensure your internal efforts reflect your commitment to DEI as well.\r\n\r\nIn other words, don't forget to be inclusive of your marketers as well, not just your audience. \r\n\r\nEven if you already have a diverse team of content creators, how much are you encouraging their ideas and perspectives? How much do you support and celebrate their differences through your company culture?\r\n\r\nWith a diverse team that feels like they belong, your content is sure to reflect that inclusivity. \r\n\r\nAnd not only will your content be better for it, but also your returns \u2014 diverse teams are up to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.mckinsey.com\/business-functions\/people-and-organizational-performance\/our-insights\/why-diversity-matters\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">35% more likely<\/a> to perform better financially than non-diverse teams.\r\n\r\nFinally \u2014 and I'm a little biased here \u2014 it can help to identify someone on your team who's relatively attuned to inclusivity and can help answer questions.\r\n\r\n<h3>11. Power Through Discomfort<\/h3>\r\nListen. I get it. This stuff is hard.\r\n\r\nHow can you bullseye a constantly moving target?\r\n\r\nThe truth is, you can do all the research you want on the front end and still say the wrong thing or face criticism \u2014 the important thing is to grow because of it.\r\n\r\n<h2>Keep Growing Up and to the Right With Your Efforts<\/h2>\r\nDEI falls under the <a href=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/conversation\/esg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Environmental, Social, and Governance<\/a> umbrella, which is a huge focus for us here at Siege.

Taking the time to set up your site right means reaping the benefits for years to come.\r\n<h2 id=\"whyecommerce\">Why Is SEO Important for E-commerce Sites?<\/h2>\r\nFor example, a search for \u201cbluetooth speaker\u201d brings up 212,000,000 organic listings \u2014 that\u2019s a lot of competition!\r\n\r\n<img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-29517\" src=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/08\/ecommerce-seo-screenshot-1.png\" alt=\"bluetooth speaker serp\" width=\"1401\" height=\"1341\" \/>\r\n\r\nEven a much more refined search for \u201cBose Soundlink Color II Bluetooth speaker\u201d brings up an astonishing 3,790,000 results:\r\n\r\n<img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-29518\" src=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/08\/ecommerce-seo-screenshot-2.png\" alt=\"bose soundlink color II bluetooth speaker\" width=\"1401\" height=\"1313\" \/>\r\n\r\nLike we said, if more than 50% of online purchases start with a search engine, it pretty much means SEO for e-commerce is a must.\r\n\r\nCompanies that invest in e-commerce should expect to see an ROI ratio of 5:1. That\u2019s a $5 return for every $1 you spend.\r\n\r\nIn other words, implement these SEO strategies and see five times the traffic and five times the revenue!\r\n\r\nRemember, SEO for any industry serves as a solid foundation to keep your site pumping for years to come \u2014 it\u2019s a long-game, not a short one. \r\n\r\nNow let\u2019s get started setting up your site for <a href=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/strategy\/increase-website-traffic\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">traffic-boosting<\/a>, revenue-generating success.\r\n<h2 id=\"optimizeecommerce\">How To Optimize Your E-commerce Site for SEO<\/h2>\r\nFrom performing preliminary research around your competitors, products, and brands to writing and marking up your site pages with the right information, e-commerce SEO is all about attracting qualified users and providing those users with everything they need to make an informed purchase decision.\r\n\r\nReady to get started?\r\n\r\nHere are seven steps to follow to set your e-commerce site up for search engine success:\r\n\r\n<img class=\"alignnone wp-image-29482 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/08\/steps-for-optimizing-your-ecommerce-site.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1400\" height=\"1151\" \/>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h3>1. Find the Right Keywords<\/h3>\r\nThe first step to an effective e-commerce SEO strategy is to discover keywords you want your site to rank for. In order to do that, you\u2019ll need to perform keyword research.\r\n\r\nBefore you begin, you\u2019ll need to be aware of two types of keywords: short- and long-tail keywords.\r\n\r\nShort-tail keywords are head terms, or a general term, and are typically short in length and have a higher search volume.\r\n\r\nLong-tail keywords are more specific or descriptive terms that are typically longer in length and have a lower search volume than short tails.\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/08\/short-tail-vs-long-tail-keywords-2.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1400\" height=\"901\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-29608\" \/>\r\n\r\nUsing a mix of both short- and long-tail keywords on your site will be important for reaching your target audience.\r\n<h4>Prioritizing Keywords<\/h4>\r\nThink you might need a hand deciding which keywords will have the most benefit?\r\n\r\nPerform a <a href=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/strategy\/kob-analysis\">KOB (Keyword Opposition to Benefit) Analysis<\/a>.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/05\/KOB-Keyword-Research.xlsx\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-27689\" src=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/11\/02-download-our-kob-cta.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1400\" height=\"550\" \/><\/a>\r\n\r\nA KOB involves pulling a keyword\u2019s #1 ranking URL, monthly search volume, difficulty, traffic value, and number of backlinks come up with a KOB score.\r\n\r\nTake your list of topics and sort them by KOB score to determine which keywords (and associated page) you should optimize first.\r\n<h3>2. Analyze Your Competitors\u2019 Performance<\/h3>\r\nHere\u2019s what I like to think of when it comes to competitor research: Competitors that perform well are an example of what you should emulate.\r\n\r\nCompetitors that perform poorly should be used as an example of what to avoid.\r\n\r\nThere are two main types of competitors: keyword and industry.\r\n<ul>\r\n \t<li><strong>Keyword competitors<\/strong> are sites that come up for an exact keyword that you\u2019re trying to rank for.<\/li>\r\n \t<li><strong>Industry competitors<\/strong> are those that sell the same products or services, but may not be competing with you for the exact keywords.<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n<img src=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/08\/keyword-competitors-vs-industry-competitors-2.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1400\" height=\"1081\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-29607\" \/>\r\n\r\nNote that your competitors can and may be a mix of both.\r\n\r\nTo analyze your competitors\u2019 performance, <strong>make a list of who you think your competitors are and plug their site into an organic listing tool like Ahrefs or Semrush<\/strong>.\r\n\r\nHere, you\u2019ll want to look at organic rankings, backlinks or referring domains, top pages, etc.\r\n\r\n<img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-29519\" src=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/08\/ecommerce-seo-screenshot-3.png\" alt=\"ahrefs site overview\" width=\"1401\" height=\"535\" \/>\r\n\r\nMy personal favorite tool to explore is the \u201ccontent gap.\u201d\r\n\r\nPlug your site and your competitors' site in to see top keywords they rank for that you don\u2019t. This can help identify areas of opportunity.\r\n\r\nThe most important step in competitor analysis for e-commerce sites is to take a <strong>look at the number of pages and products your competitors have.<\/strong>\r\n\r\nIf your top competitors have 2,000 to 3,000 products listed on their site while you only have 10, it will likely be tough to compete with them.\r\n<h3>3. Create a Visual Sitemap<\/h3>\r\nIf you\u2019re starting your e-commerce site from scratch, you\u2019ll want to create an ideal layout that is easy for users and crawlers (like Google) to navigate.\r\n\r\nIf you already have a site set up, reference this section to make sure your site has a strong hierarchy, then skip to <strong>step 4.<\/strong>\r\n\r\nI like to think of a visual sitemap as a guide to what your site navigation and <a href=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/seo\/how-to-create-the-best-url-structures\">URL structure<\/a> will be.\r\n\r\nHere\u2019s an example of how your sitemap might look: \r\n\r\n<img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-29477\" src=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/08\/ecommerce-site-map.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1400\" height=\"1101\" \/>\r\n\r\n<strong>Note:<\/strong> You should also have a technical <a href=\"https:\/\/yoast.com\/what-is-an-xml-sitemap-and-why-should-you-have-one\/\">XML sitemap<\/a> (typically generated automatically from your CDN).\r\n\r\nYou should submit that sitemap to <a href=\"https:\/\/search.google.com\/u\/1\/search-console\/about\">Google Search Console<\/a> so Google can find, crawl, and index your site pages.\r\n\r\nCheck out our step-by-step instructions on how to execute a content audit <a href=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/seo\/content-audit\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">here<\/a>.\r\n\r\n<h3>4. Choose One Keyword for Each Page<\/h3>\r\nOnce you\u2019ve done your research and decided which pages will be on your site, you\u2019ll next want to assign one focus keyword for each of your pages.\r\n\r\nI like to do this by dropping my sitemap into a spreadsheet and placing the focus keyword next to the page.\r\n\r\nUsing your sitemap and your keyword research, decide which keywords go best with each page.\r\n\r\nIt\u2019s important that each page has a unique keyword. For products that are similar, it\u2019s okay if the keyword is only slightly different:\r\n<ul>\r\n \t<li>Product 1: Bose Soundlink Color I bluetooth speaker<\/li>\r\n \t<li>Product 2: Bose Soundlink Color II bluetooth speaker<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n\r\n<blockquote class=\"definition\"><strong>What makes a good focus keyword?<\/strong> An ideal focus keyword will be one with a relatively high volume and a low to moderate difficulty score.\r\n\r\nFor Ahrefs, I like to consider anything less than a difficulty of 40 as low to moderate. A great way to see what you could potentially rank for is to see what your competitors rank for.<\/blockquote>\r\n\r\nOnce chosen, you will use these keywords throughout your site copy and in your metadata.\r\n<h3>5. Create and Implement Metadata<\/h3>\r\nMetadata is all of the textual information that describes your page.\r\n\r\nThis helps search engines and users determine what your page is all about, and also plays a huge factor in ranking.\r\n\r\nUsing your focus keyword, you\u2019ll next want to create the following metadata for each of your pages:\r\n<ul>\r\n \t<li>URL<\/li>\r\n \t<li>Focus keyword<\/li>\r\n \t<li>H1 (title of the page)<\/li>\r\n \t<li>Title tag (what users will click on to navigate to your page)<\/li>\r\n \t<li>Meta description<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n<blockquote class=\"definition\"><strong>Prop tip:<\/strong> Map out all of your metadata in a spreadsheet to make it easier to copy and paste into your site.<\/blockquote>\r\n\r\n<h4><strong>Metadata Best Practices<\/strong><\/h4>\r\n<ul>\r\n \t<li><strong>Keywords first.<\/strong> Place your focus keyword as close to the front of your tags as possible.<\/li>\r\n \t<li><strong>Make each tag unique.<\/strong> Your title tag, meta description, and H1 should all be different from each other and unique to each specific product or page.<\/li>\r\n \t<li><strong>Use action words in title tags and meta descriptions.<\/strong> Title tags and meta descriptions are the first thing your customer sees before entering your site. For your product pages, make sure they include words like \u201cbuy now,\u201d \u201cbrowse,\u201d and \u201corder today\u201d to further entice users to click through to your site.<\/li>\r\n \t<li><strong>Avoid keyword stuffing.<\/strong> While it\u2019s important to include keywords in your tags, using them too much can actually hurt your rankings. Opt to use your focus keyword once in each tag.<\/li>\r\n \t<li><strong>Keep it short (ish).<\/strong> Remember to keep each tag within the recommended length requirements. <a href=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/seo\/title-tags\">Title tags<\/a> should be within 45-60 characters and meta descriptions within 145-155. H1s should be under 70 characters and URLs less than 2,048.<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\nHere\u2019s what my metadata might look like for Bose Soundlink Color II bluetooth speaker:\r\n\r\n<img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-29479\" src=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/08\/metadata-example.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1400\" height=\"811\" \/>\r\nOnce you\u2019ve created all of this juicy <a href=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/strategy\/on-page-seo\">optimized metadata<\/a>, you can then implement it into your pages.\r\n<h3>6. Optimize Your Site Pages<\/h3>\r\nIf you take just one thing from this guide, let it be the importance of optimizing your product pages.\r\n\r\nSince <a href=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/strategy\/ecommerce-statistics\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">e-commerce data<\/a> proves these pages are where conversions happen, it\u2019s important that your users have everything they need when browsing (and purchasing) your product.\r\n\r\n<h4>Optimizing Your Product Pages<\/h4>\r\n\r\nThe top product section should include easy-to-scan information for users that are ready to purchase. This should include:\r\n<ul>\r\n \t<li>A strong product title (h1)<\/li>\r\n \t<li>Model\/sku # (if applicable)<\/li>\r\n \t<li>Star reviews<\/li>\r\n \t<li>Color options<\/li>\r\n \t<li>Several images<\/li>\r\n \t<li>Pricing<\/li>\r\n \t<li>Delivery options<\/li>\r\n \t<li>Add to cart buttons (or other CTAs)<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\nHere\u2019s a great top fold product page from Best Buy:\r\n\r\n<img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-29520\" src=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/08\/ecommerce-seo-screenshot-4.png\" alt=\"best buy product page\" width=\"1401\" height=\"1221\" \/>\r\n\r\nYou\u2019ll notice everything listed and more is implemented on this product page: a descriptive product title, model number, color options, star reviews, pricing and coupons, multiple images, delivery options, and a CTA.\r\n\r\nThe customer has everything they need to make a purchase decision here.\r\n\r\nOn the lower fold of the page (typically beneath the images), is where the beefy information comes in. This should include\u2026\r\n<ul>\r\n \t<li>A strong description\/overview of the product<\/li>\r\n \t<li>Product features<\/li>\r\n \t<li>Callouts or specifications: dimensions, color options, etc. Bonus points if you can describe how to use it and offer info about return policies.<\/li>\r\n \t<li>Detailed reviews<\/li>\r\n \t<li>FAQs<\/li>\r\n \t<li>Related Products<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n<img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-29521\" src=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/08\/ecommerce-seo-screenshot-5.png\" alt=\"best buy product page details\" width=\"1401\" height=\"1001\" \/>\r\n\r\nOn the bottom fold of that same Best Buy product page, you can see that they have more information about the product to help inform their customers.\r\n\r\n<img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-29480\" src=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/08\/product-page-optimization-checklist.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1400\" height=\"1201\" \/>\r\n\r\n<h4>Optimizing Your Category Pages<\/h4>\r\n\r\nCategory pages are the users\u2019 map to the products of your site, so they should be easy to navigate and should include all of the products within the category.\r\n\r\nHere\u2019s what a well-optimized product category page should include:\r\n<ul>\r\n \t<li>Filter options (colors, brands, sizes, prices, etc.).<\/li>\r\n \t<li>A grid of products.<\/li>\r\n \t<li>For each product: a title, image, the price, and a CTA (either view, quick look, add to cart or a mixture of both).<\/li>\r\n \t<li>Pagination for a clear view of where the user came from to get to the page they\u2019re on. More on that in the next section.<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n<h3 id=\"markup\">7. Implement Schema Markup<\/h3>\r\nSchema markup is another way for search engines to better understand your content and, most importantly, your products.\r\n\r\nOften overlooked in rudimentary e-commerce sites, the following markup is recommended for a fully-optimized e-commerce site:\r\n<h4>Breadcrumbs<\/h4>\r\nBreadcrumbList markup is a trail that shows users which position a page is in in your site\u2019s hierarchy. This is also referred to as \u201cpagination.\u201d Here\u2019s what this looks like on Best Buy\u2019s Portable Speakers Category page:\r\n\r\n<img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-29522\" src=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/08\/ecommerce-seo-screenshot-6.png\" alt=\"best buy breadcrumbs example\" width=\"1401\" height=\"691\" \/>\r\n\r\nThe Breadcrumbs show a clear path of how I navigated to that page.\r\n\r\n<em>Home &gt; Audio &gt; Bluetooth &amp; Wireless Speakers &gt; Portable Speakers<\/em>\r\n<h4>Product<\/h4>\r\nProduct schema is back-end data that gives crawlers more information about your product. This includes the SKU, a description, pricing, number of reviews, aggregate rating, and more.\r\n<h4>FAQ<\/h4>\r\nFrequently asked questions help to provide users with more information about a product or topic.\r\n\r\nIt\u2019s been speculated that FAQs are the quickest way to nab a rich snippet on the SERPs. They often help pages rank in People Also Ask boxes and Featured Snippets.\r\n\r\nFor each of your FAQ sections, generate schema for free with technicalseo.com\u2019s <a href=\"https:\/\/technicalseo.com\/tools\/schema-markup-generator\/\">Schema Markup Generator<\/a> tool.\r\n<h3>8. Get Found On Search Engines<\/h3>\r\nYour awesome on-page and technical e-commerce SEO only matters if the search engines know you exist!\r\n\r\nSubmit your sitemap to <a href=\"https:\/\/search.google.com\/search-console\/about\">Google Search Console<\/a> and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.bing.com\/webmasters\/about\">Bing Webmaster Tools<\/a> so search engines can crawl and index your site pages.\r\n\r\nUsing these tools, you\u2019ll be able to see which pages are being indexed, track impressions, clicks, click-through rates, average position and monitor schema validation, page experience, and core web vitals.\r\n<h2 id=\"bestpractices\">Don\u2019t Forget E-commerce SEO Best Practices<\/h2>\r\n<h3>Create Great Supporting Content<\/h3>\r\nOne of the most overlooked ways of driving traffic to an e-commerce site is <a href=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/seo\/content-strategy\">creating content<\/a> surrounding your products.\r\n\r\nIn the era of E-A-T (experience, authority, and trust), the sites that have the most credible, helpful information are the ones that perform the best.\r\n\r\nGreat <a href=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/creation\/types-of-content-marketing\">content types<\/a> for e-commerce sites are:\r\n<ul>\r\n \t<li>Infographics<\/li>\r\n \t<li>Questions and answers<\/li>\r\n \t<li>How-to guides (How To Furnish Your Home On A Budget)<\/li>\r\n \t<li>Specific brand\/product guides<\/li>\r\n \t<li>Interactives<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n<blockquote class=\"definition\"><strong>Where to find <a href=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/strategy\/content-marketing-examples\">content inspiration<\/a>:<\/strong> Going all the way back to the keyword research phase, plug in one of your head terms back into a keyword research tool. Under keyword ideas, you\u2019ll find related terms in Ahrefs, \u201cquestions.\u201d<\/blockquote>\r\n\r\n<h3>Link Building<\/h3>\r\nEarning links from other, reputable websites is a great way to <a href=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/seo\/what-is-eat\">boost your E-A-T<\/a> and get more users to your site.\r\n\r\nUse a tool like Ahrefs backlink checker to see what links you already have and identify opportunities for new links.\r\n\r\nCreating awesome <a href=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/strategy\/ecommerce-content-marketing\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">e-commerce content<\/a> is a great passive link building technique that requires no outreach effort. An informative, helpful piece of content will do the work on its own by being a source of information that other sites will naturally want to share with their users.\r\n\r\nLearn more about our philosophy on passive link building <a href=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/marketing\/manual-link-building\">here<\/a>.\r\n<h3>Optimize Page Performance<\/h3>\r\nDid you know that for every extra second it takes your page to load, conversion rates drop by a little over 4%? (<a href=\"https:\/\/www.portent.com\/blog\/analytics\/research-site-speed-hurting-everyones-revenue.htm#:~:text=The%20first%205%20seconds%20of,(between%20seconds%200%2D5)\">Portent<\/a>, 2019)\r\n\r\nWith mobile-first indexing completely rolled out, and a closer look being taken at page experience (looking at core web vitals!), it\u2019s never been more important to deliver a quick, light site that's easy to use.\r\n\r\nTo check to see if your site is mobile-friendly, plug your domain into <a href=\"https:\/\/search.google.com\/test\/mobile-friendly\">Google\u2019s Mobile-Friendly Test<\/a>.\r\n\r\n<strong>Five ways to improve load times:<\/strong>\r\n<ul>\r\n \t<li>Choose a responsive web design.<\/li>\r\n \t<li>Keep image sizes under 250 kb.<\/li>\r\n \t<li>Implement caching.<\/li>\r\n \t<li>Make sure pop-ups are non-obstructive and easy to close.<\/li>\r\n \t<li>Minify HTML, CSS and\/or JavaScript.<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n<h3>Add Alt Text to Images<\/h3>\r\nAlt text serves as a caption for your images. Since crawlers can\u2019t actually see your images, this is how they decipher what\u2019s in it. Alt text should describe exactly what\u2019s in your image.\r\n\r\nFor the image below, my alt text might be: \u201cBlack Bose SoundLink Flex Portable Bluetooth Speaker on a workbench\u201d\r\n\r\n<img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-29523\" src=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/08\/ecommerce-seo-screenshot-7.png\" alt=\"bose portable speaker\" width=\"1401\" height=\"1301\" \/>\r\n\r\nIt completely describes the image and uses the keyword (product name), which can help it to show up in the image search results.\r\n<h3>Make Your Site Structure Clear<\/h3>\r\nAn easy-to-use site is a well-performing site.\r\n\r\nA clear site structure will show users (and crawlers) how it is your site is set up and how to get to and from each page to the next.\r\n\r\nTo make your site structure nice and obvious, <strong>make sure your URL, breadcrumbs, and navigation structure all match.<\/strong> See here:\r\n\r\n<img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-29483\" src=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/08\/url-vs-breadcrumbs-vs-navigation.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1400\" height=\"1401\" \/>\r\n\r\nYou can see here that each new folder is accounted for in each element. This folder structure should also be reflected in your navigation. I have my <strong>main category<\/strong> (audio), a <strong>sub-category<\/strong> (bluetooth speakers) and my <strong>product<\/strong> (Bose Soundlink Color II).\r\n\r\nSite structure is especially important for e-commerce sites with several product categories and subcategories. The easier it is to navigate your site, the happier your users will be, and the better it will perform.\r\n\r\n<strong>Add links to similar products<\/strong> on each of your product pages and internally link to helpful pages to allow for better link flow throughout your site.\r\n<h3>Allow Reviews On Product Pages<\/h3>\r\nThere\u2019s nothing more transparent than honest reviews from your current customers. And this type of information is valuable to shoppers and search engines both.\r\n\r\nWhat\u2019s more, over 90% of customers will look for reviews before they purchase a product, according to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.shopify.com\/blog\/15359677-why-online-store-owners-should-embrace-online-reviews\">Shopify<\/a>.\r\n\r\nReviews allow users to see even more information on the product and is coveted by search engines. Add review schema to encourage rich results and boost the chances of your product page being found by your audience.\r\n<h3>Add Helpful FAQs<\/h3>\r\nFrequently Asked Question sections are a great way to provide more information to users in an intuitive way.\r\n\r\nWhat questions do you usually get for your products? What other information might your audience want to know? Add them right into your product pages.\r\n\r\nIf you\u2019re stumped on what questions to include, here are two great ways to find some inspiration:\r\n<h4>People Also Ask Box<\/h4>\r\nType your product or product category name into the SERP and see what questions come up in the People Also Ask box. These are the most common questions surrounding the search, or in this case, your product.\r\n\r\n<img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-29524\" src=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/08\/ecommerce-seo-screenshot-8.png\" alt=\"people also ask box example\" width=\"1401\" height=\"601\" \/>\r\n<h4>Keyword Research Tools<\/h4>\r\nWithin Ahref\u2019s keyword explorer, you\u2019ll find a section called \u201cQuestions.\u201d This is another great place to find some hidden FAQ gems.\r\n\r\n<img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-29525\" src=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/08\/ecommerce-seo-screenshot-9.png\" alt=\"bose soundlink color II keyword research\" width=\"1401\" height=\"1171\" \/>\r\n\r\n<strong>P.S.<\/strong> Don\u2019t forget to add FAQ schema wherever you have FAQs.\r\n<h2>Stay Calm. E-commerce SEO Is Worth It<\/h2>\r\nFrom well-executed keyword research to ensure your site structure is clear, there is a long list of boxes that need to be checked for optimal e-commerce SEO.\r\n\r\nHowever, don't panic. Once you optimize your website, you can continue to iterate on best practices over time, and before you know it, you'll find yourself standing out on that 212,000,000 search result.\r\n\r\nIf you don't have the resources internally to rank, we're here to help. <a href=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/business-form\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Reach out to our SEO team<\/a> to get your site ranking."

    "title": "SEO for Financial Services: Successful Strategies",
    "content": "Why is it essential to have a strategic plan for financial services SEO? Not only must you overcome slow-moving and highly regulated processes, but the financial industry is the most competitive SEO vertical online.\r\n\r\nFinancial services SEO is a digital marketing strategy that helps companies in the financial industry optimize their website to be found by and rank on search engines which result in more traffic and conversions. \r\n\r\nSiege has been fortunate enough to have worked with many <a href=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/work\/finance\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">incredible finance companies<\/a>, such as Zebra and Homebuyer. Through these relationships, we\u2019ve learned and mastered the repeatable SEO strategies that perform exceptionally in finance markets.\r\n\r\nIn this post, you\u2019ll learn some of the challenges that marketers in the financial sector face and the best solutions and strategies to overcome these challenges with the help of SEO and creative initiative.\r\n\r\nMake sure to stick around till the end to see our simplified bulleted list of the best strategies to overcome all of the challenges the financial industry will throw at you.\r\n\r\n<h2>Marketing Challenges of a Highly Regulated Company<\/h2>\r\n\r\nThe financial services industry has to deal with some of the strictest regulations which makes it tough to navigate an ever-advancing online market. \r\n\r\nThese companies must adhere to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.ftc.gov\/business-guidance\/advertising-marketing\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">federal<\/a>, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.ncsl.org\/research\/telecommunications-and-information-technology\/state-laws-related-to-internet-privacy.aspx\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">state<\/a>, and local regulations as well as <a href=\"https:\/\/support.google.com\/adspolicy\/answer\/2464998?hl=en\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Google\u2019s financial products and services advertising restrictions<\/a>.\r\n\r\nOnce we understand the obstacles of the financial industry we can better implement a sound SEO and marketing strategy. \r\n<h3>Legal Obstacles of Digital Marketing<\/h3>\r\n\r\nDue to there being so many strict regulations, this can result in marketing processes being slowed down and strung out as a legal team reviews your items. \r\n\r\nThis can cause a backlog of content waiting for review or website changes that never happen. \r\n\r\nThe two best ways to avoid legal issues and stopgaps are:\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Have a writer on your team who also has a legal background and is experienced in navigating high regulations.<\/li>\r\n<li>Have your writers work closely with a dedicated member of your legal team that has assisting with content and marketing reviews as part of their job.<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n<h3>How Silos Slow Success<\/h3>\r\nThe high regulations previously mentioned can also lead to silos forming between internal departments.\r\n<img src=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/08\/department-silos.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1401\" height=\"596\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-29189\" \/> \r\n\r\nThis means that multiple departments within the same company will not communicate too often and will rarely share information or plans with each other. \r\n\r\nBy having monthly internal company meetings that involve all relevant departments, you can ensure you don\u2019t have silos within your company.\r\n<h4>Separation Can Cause Brand Inconsistency<\/h4>\r\n\r\nOne potential outcome of silos within a company is brand inconsistency. Brand inconsistency is when there is a lack of a single brand voice which results in a missed opportunity to resonate with your customer. \r\n\r\nThe biggest issue that can typically arise from brand inconsistency is users might not fully understand what you do or what you stand for. This can ultimately result in your company appearing to have no clear identity.\r\n\r\nA solution to help avoid brand inconsistency is by having your entire company follow strict brand guidelines to ensure customers have a cohesive experience at all touchpoints in the customer journey.\r\n<h3>Impacts of Limited Internal Resources<\/h3>\r\n\r\nAnother major obstacle that companies in the financial industry face are limited internal resources. This can come in the form of department budgets, technology, or even people. \r\n\r\nMarketing campaigns can quickly become expensive if you want to reach users through multiple channels and touchpoints.\r\n\r\nThe best solution for this is to have a team with diverse expertise or omnichannel marketing experience\r\n\r\nAnother great solution is using a marketing agency that gives you access to an entire team of experts with diverse backgrounds and access to advanced technical tools that are typically too expensive for a single company to pay for. \r\n<h3>Appeasing Digital-first Customers<\/h3>\r\n\r\nDigital-first customers are people who expect to have a flawless experience when accessing their financial services between different digital sources, whether that be via email, website, or an app. \r\n\r\nA <a href=\"https:\/\/www.gobankingrates.com\/banking\/banks\/85-percent-people-prefer-banking-online-mobile-app-what-are-best-bets\/?utm_campaign=1154329&utm_source=yahoo.com&utm_content=14&utm_medium=rss#:~:text=According%20to%20a%20GOBankingRates,or%20a%20mobile%20app\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">recent study<\/a> found that 85% of Americans prefer to bank online and 55% prefer to use a mobile app specifically. \r\n\r\nWith such high expectations from customers, it creates a challenge for many financial institutions that lack the resources to make this happen. \r\n\r\n<img src=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/08\/online-banking-stat.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1401\" height=\"594\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-29191\" \/>\r\n\r\nSince people expect a perfectly functioning website or app, if you lack the resources to create both seamlessly, then it\u2019s recommended to hold off on an app and invest in creating an incredible website for your financial service.\r\n\r\n<blockquote class=\"definition\">The majority of Gen Z and Gen Y are using mobile banking, with 51% of Gen Z and 64% of Gen Y using it to check their balances and activity.

This is achieved by mastering SEO. \r\n\r\nSEO is essential because it allows your website to be more visible, which results in driving more traffic and conversions. \r\n\r\nHowever, most companies have at least some aspects of SEO incorporated into their website. So, if you want to outrank them all, you will need to fully optimize your website. \r\n\r\nThis will take a combination of the following factors:\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/strategy\/on-page-seo\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">On-page SEO<\/a><\/li>\r\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/strategy\/off-page-seo\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Off-page SEO<\/a><\/li>\r\n<li>Local SEO<\/li>\r\n<li>Technical SEO<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\nWe will dive a bit deeper into all of these in the sections below. \r\n<h3>Quality SEO-Driven Content is Required for Complex Topics<\/h3>\r\n\r\nYou may have heard the saying \u201ccontent is king\u201d before. This means that content is the most important factor for a website's performance over all other things. \r\n\r\nThis can be seen as even more important in the finance industry, since many topics are complex and deal with people's money. \r\n\r\nHowever, being in such a competitive industry, creating well-written content is not enough to make you rise above the competition. You need to ensure the content you\u2019re writing is also <a href=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/creation\/seo-friendly-content\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">SEO friendly<\/a>. \r\n\r\nThis means the content is created not only for users but also for search engines. This is done through a myriad of SEO factors such as the following:\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Use a SERP Analysis to generate your content strategy.<\/a><\/li>\r\n<li>Optimize <a href=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/seo\/how-to-create-the-best-url-structures\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">URL structure<\/a> to include the main target keyword.<\/li>\r\n<li>Include an optimized title tag and meta description.<\/li>\r\n<li>Naturally incorporate keywords into headings and copy.<\/li>\r\n<li>Add alt text to all images.<\/li>\r\n<li>Optimize page structure for scannability.<\/li>\r\n<li>Include at least five links to other content on your website with optimized anchor text.<\/li>\r\n<li>Link to your newly created page from other existing relevant pages.<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\nThis makes it extremely important to have an internal writer on your team that has SEO knowledge or to hire an <a href=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/services\/content-creation\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">agency that specializes in creating SEO content<\/a>. \r\n<h3>Y.M.Y.L. Makes E-A-T Essential for Finance Companies<\/h3>\r\n\r\nFinance is a <a href=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/seo\/ymyl\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Y.M.Y.L or Your Money Your Life<\/a> industry, which means that it\u2019s content that has the power to affect people's decisions with their money or life. \r\n\r\nContent that falls under Y.M.Y.L is held to a much higher standard since it can easily help or hurt people (that's a lot of pressure).\r\n\r\nSince Y.M.Y.L content is held to such high standards, it basically requires you to focus on E-A-T: Expertise, authoritativeness, and trustworthiness.\r\n\r\nAlthough E-A-T is not a direct ranking factor in Google\u2019s algorithm, it\u2019s still a massive part of their <a href=\"https:\/\/static.googleusercontent.com\/media\/guidelines.raterhub.com\/en\/\/searchqualityevaluatorguidelines.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Search Quality Evaluator Guidelines<\/a> and can prevent pages from ranking well if it is not present. \r\n\r\nPrioritizing E-A-T will not only require you to provide users with valuable content that can help them make educated and informed decisions, but it also requires the content to be provided by a person who has subject matter authority.\r\n\r\nIn the financial space, this might look like a person who is a CPA or has some industry certification. Or it could be a writer who has X+ years of writing in the financial space. \r\n\r\nYou can display this with some sort of credentials or social proof of their background.\r\n\r\nThe author's bio should include any information that proves they can and should be trusted, such as:\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Education level<\/li>\r\n<li>Years of experience<\/li>\r\n<li>Certificates<\/li> \r\n<li>Licenses<\/li>\r\n<li>Awards<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\nAlthough it\u2019s ideal to have this expert as the writer of the content, it\u2019s understood that these individuals might not have the time to create full in-depth articles on complex topics. \r\n\r\nAnother way you can still adhere to E-A-T is by having an expert review the content after you write it and stating it on the page. \r\n\r\n<img src=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/bankrate-credibility.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"396\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-27712\" \/>\r\n\r\nBankrate does a great job of adhering to E-A-T by providing information on the writer, editor, and even a reviewer for the post before you get into the content. \r\n\r\nEach of these three people has bios that are available on hover \u2014 providing immediate trust for readers looking to learn more.\r\n<h3>Data Collection is a Must<\/h3>\r\n\r\n<a href=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/creation\/data-sources\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Data on customers<\/a> is arguably one of the most valuable assets a company can have. This is because customer data allows you to make data-driven decisions and have targeted marketing. \r\n\r\nDespite this, many companies in the finance industry are still using legacy technology and don\u2019t collect any online data at all. \r\n\r\nIf your company is not collecting any online data from your website and app, then you need to change that today. \r\n\r\nAt the very least, we recommend setting up the following: \r\n<ul>\r\n<li><b>Google Analytics:<\/b> Track data, conversions, and more for your website and\/or app.<\/li>\r\n<li><b>Google Search Console:<\/b> Check indexing status, search queries, crawl errors, and more plus helps optimize for website visibility.<\/li>\r\n<li><b>Google Ads:<\/b> If your company does any paid online marketing this will allow you to create and manage ads plus gain data from those ads.<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/08\/types-of-data-collection-platforms.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1401\" height=\"539\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-29193\" \/>\r\n\r\nOnce you have all of these tools set up on your website, you will then want to link them to your Google Analytics account so that you can pull all the data into one place. This will help you turn it into visualizations and discover useful insights. \r\n\r\n<blockquote class=\"definition\"><b>Pro Tip:<\/b> Using the data you collect from Google Ads and Analytics you can create personalized and targeted ads. <\/blockquote>\r\n\r\nStudies have shown that <a href=\"https:\/\/www.adlucent.com\/resources\/blog\/71-of-consumers-prefer-personalized-ads\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">71% of customers<\/a> prefer personalized ads, and there is a higher chance of the ads leading to a conversion when compared to generalized advertising. \r\n\r\n<img src=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/08\/personalize-ads-stat-1.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1401\" height=\"715\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-29403\" \/>\r\n\r\n<h3>The High Value of Links for SEO in the Financial Industry<\/h3>\r\n\r\nThe <a href=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/strategy\/content-marketing-roi\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">lifetime link value<\/a> for the financial services sector is frequently greater than $15,000. \r\n\r\nThese high values can be attributed to two main factors: \r\n<ul>\r\n<li>The financial industry is very valuable.<\/li>\r\n<li>Links are extremely difficult to acquire in this industry.<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\nUnlike other industries where natural links are common, the financial industry will rarely see free natural links to content. \r\n\r\nEven if you spend countless hours doing manual <a href=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/seo\/link-building-cost\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">link building<\/a>, you might only see a few successful links. \r\n\r\nThis is primarily because people know the value a link can hold and that your end goal is to generate money. For this reason, they will likely request you to pay them to get the link.\r\n\r\nThe best solution to generate natural links is to create outstanding content that stands out with items like <a href=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/creation\/interactive-content\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">interactive assets<\/a> or statistics that people want to reference. \r\n\r\n<img src=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/08\/bankrate-loan-calculator.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1401\" height=\"657\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-29404\" \/>\r\n\r\nBankrate has a helpful loan calculator that allows users to calculate amortized loans. In less than five months of being live, this page has driven almost 13,000 backlinks (and counting).\r\n\r\nWe're big fans of this content. So much so that Siege recently decided to <a href=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/marketing\/manual-link-building\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">stop (most) manual link building<\/a> \u2014 instead, we focused our efforts on creating SEO-driven content of the highest quality (like interactive and statistics-type content).\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/07\/roi-of-manual-vs-passive-link-building.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1400\" height=\"1255\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-29098\" \/>\r\n\r\nThis resulted in dramatically improving our content productivity while still driving just as many (if not more) links.\r\n<h3>Focus on Local SEO<\/h3>\r\n\r\nMany financial services still have brick and mortar stores that customers can visit in person. Because of this, local SEO for financial services is something you need to focus on. \r\n\r\nTo optimize for local SEO, it\u2019s important to have individual pages on your website for each location that targets those local keywords. \r\n\r\nAnother extremely important part of local SEO is creating a Google My Business (GMB) listing for each of your physical store locations. This will help ensure you show up on the SERPs for people doing local searches.\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/08\/google-my-business-listing-for-a-bank.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1401\" height=\"1390\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-29190\" \/>\r\n\r\nHere is a list of the most important local SEO factors:\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Optimize for local keywords.<\/li>\r\n<li>Increase user reviews for your location.<\/li>\r\n<li>Optimize your GMB listings.<\/li>\r\n<li>Link any maps on your local pages to the corresponding GMB listing.<\/li>\r\n<li>Ensure your name, address, and phone number are correct and consistent on any local directories.<\/li>\r\n<li>Add local business structured data.<\/li>\r\n<li>Perform local link building.<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\nBy focusing on each of these items listed above, you will greatly improve your local rankings and increase the chances of users finding your website with a local search. \r\n<h3>Technical SEO Isn\u2019t Your Top Priority<\/h3>\r\n\r\nMost websites in the financial space only have around 10,000 pages or less on their website. This is relatively low when compared to e-commerce sites that might have upwards of 250 million pages. \r\n\r\nHaving a smaller website reduces the chance that you will face any major technical issues. \r\n\r\nThis doesn\u2019t mean you should completely disregard technical issues, but you can probably get away with just having one person within your organization that has technical SEO expertise monitor and audit the website for any red flags. \r\n\r\nThe more common SEO issues you will face for your website in the financial service industry are on the page level. \r\n\r\nThis will require you to find custom ways to address the problems rather than a large-scale fix for thousands of pages due to something wrong with the website's infrastructure.  \r\n<h2>How To Master the Financial Services SEO & Marketing Industry<\/h2>\r\n\r\nDespite the numerous challenges of online marketing in the financial service industry outlined above, the benefits of rising to the top of this vertical far outweigh the challenges. \r\n\r\nTo sum up the strategies that you should follow to master financial services SEO and marketing, we created a list below:\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/08\/10-tips-to-master-the-financial-services-SEO-and-marketing-industry.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1401\" height=\"1625\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-29402\" \/>\r\n\r\nMastering the hypercompetitive financial services SEO and marketing industry is no easy feat, but it can be done following the strategies outlined above. \r\n\r\nLooking to accomplish this at an accelerated rate?

    "content": "A great blog post delivers solutions to your audience's problems in an easy, digestible way. \r\n\r\nTo accomplish blog post best practices, establishing trust with your brand is crucial to ultimately convert your readers into customers.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/work\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Siege Media has created content for clients<\/a> who went from having just 286 website visits to generating over $195,000 in sales. \r\n\r\nAre we magicians? No, just a group of marketers who follow a specific formula for creating blog content that drives traffic and ranks. \r\n\r\nAre you ready to learn <a href=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/creation\/high-converting-content\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">how to write a blog that converts<\/a> but don\u2019t know where to start? \r\n\r\nIn this guide, we\u2019ll break down exactly what makes a good blog post, including the proven formulas that work for websites that drive millions of visits a year. \r\n\r\n<h2>The Anatomy of a Good Blog Post<\/h2>\r\n<h3>1. A Clearly Defined Target Audience<\/h3>\r\nChoosing a topic with your target audience in mind is one of the hallmarks of a good blog post, and it begins before you put a single word on the page. \r\n\r\nYou can\u2019t craft an impactful message without knowing its intended audience. To write blog posts that resonate, choosing a topic based on the wants, needs, and desires of your target audience is essential. \r\n\r\nIf you haven\u2019t already defined your buyer personas, spend some time uncovering them through audience research. \r\n\r\nHere are some questions to help you get started: \r\n<ul>\r\n<li>What age group is your audience?<\/li>\r\n<li>What is their income bracket?<\/li>\r\n<li>What do they like to do in their free time?<\/li>\r\n<li>What challenges do they face in their everyday life?<\/li> \r\n<li>What are their goals and aspirations?<\/li> \r\n<li>What do they love?<\/li>\r\n<li>What do they hate?<\/li>\r\n<li>What problems are they trying to solve?<\/li>\r\n<\/ul> \r\n\r\n<img src=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/08\/audience-research-question-checklist.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1400\" height=\"965\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-29362\" \/>\r\n\r\nUltimately, writing what your audience cares about creates better results.\r\n\r\n<h3>2. A Compelling Headline<\/h3>\r\nEven world-class content can fall short if no one clicks on it. \r\n\r\nYour <a href=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/creation\/blog-title-examples\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">post title<\/a> could be your only shot at drawing readers in, so it\u2019s worth spending the extra time writing one that accomplishes that goal. \r\n\r\nWe created a formula to help guide the brainstorming process. \r\n<blockquote class=\"definition\">Blog Title Formula: <strong>Keyword + Purpose + Value + Action\/Adjective<\/strong><\/blockquote>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><b>Keywords:<\/b> Place your target keyword towards the front of your title.<\/li> \r\n<li><b>Purpose:<\/b> Make it clear what readers can expect in the post.\r\n<li><b>Value:<\/b> Let readers know why they should read your post. What value awaits them in the article to follow?<\/li>\r\n<li><b>Action\/Adjective:<\/b> Insert a call to action or a catchy adjective to further pique interest and compel readers to click.<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/08\/blog-title-formula-keyword-purpose-value-action.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1400\" height=\"910\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-29364\" \/>\r\n\r\nAssess your working title and ask yourself, \u201cWould this make me want to click?\u201d \r\n\r\nFinally, be sure your headline is written firstly for humans, not Google.\r\n\r\n<h3>3. A Strong Lead<\/h3>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"video-container\"><iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/IgIzR2Z21nI\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen><\/iframe><\/div>\r\n\r\nYou\u2019ve captured your audience\u2019s attention with your headline \u2014 now you need to maintain it. \r\n\r\nA strong introduction assures the reader that your post holds the information they\u2019re looking for, ideally in five sentences or less. \r\n\r\nOur preferred method for writing stellar introductions? The <a href=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/creation\/blog-introductions\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Attention, Preview, Proof, and Benefit (APPB) formula<\/a>. \r\n\r\nHere\u2019s the breakdown: \r\n<h4>Attention<\/h4>\r\nAttention is exactly what it sounds like \u2014 the first sentence of your introduction should immediately grab the reader's attention and compel them to keep reading. \r\n\r\nYou can do this by sharing a shocking statistic, challenging a common belief, or opening with a thought-provoking question. \r\n\r\nThink of the emotion you want to trigger in the reader \u2014 what problem led them to your blog post, and how does it make them feel?\r\n \r\n<h4>Preview<\/h4>\r\nThe preview is how you let visitors know they\u2019re in the right place. Show the reader what they can expect in the article and confirm that your post has the information they need.\r\n\r\n<h4>Proof<\/h4>\r\nYou need to let readers know that you\u2019re a credible source for the information you\u2019re sharing. Providing proof shows readers why they should listen to you. \r\n\r\nThis is a good opportunity to cite internal statistics or case studies that back up what you\u2019re saying. If you don\u2019t have any, simply adding an author bio at the top works too. \r\n\r\nHere\u2019s an example of <b>P<\/b>review and <b>P<\/b>roof in action in one of our own posts: \r\n\r\n<img src=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/08\/screenshot-ppb-formula.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1400\" height=\"1204\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-29369\" \/>\r\n\r\n<h4>Benefit<\/h4>\r\nIf the goal of the introduction is to maintain your reader\u2019s attention, be sure to highlight what they have to gain by reading your post. \r\n\r\nThere\u2019s hundreds of other posts they could go to for the same information \u2014 let them know upfront why yours is the best. \r\n\r\n<h3>4. An Optimized Post Structure<\/h3> \r\n\r\n<div class=\"video-container\"><iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/Lh2ryMqrPtk\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen><\/iframe><\/div>\r\n\r\n<a href=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/seo\/post-structure-for-seo\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">How your post is structured matters<\/a> \u2014 both for your readers and for ranking on the SERP. \r\n\r\nSemrush analyzed 500,000 articles and found that the 47% of articles with advanced headings structures (H2s, H3s, and H4s) belong to the highest-performing organic content group.\r\n\r\nThis helps you succeed with both readers and search engines for a few reasons: \r\n<ul>\r\n<li>It helps Google extract relevant information for Quick Answers, People Also Ask boxes, and other search queries.<\/li> \r\n<li>Aids Google to quickly understand the purpose of the post.<\/li> \r\n<li>It gives the reader the information in a quick, digestible way, increasing their time on site.<\/li> \r\n<\/ul>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/08\/the-value-of-an-optimized-post-structure.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1400\" height=\"703\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-29370\" \/>\r\n\r\n<h4>How To Structure Your Post with Headers<\/h4>\r\nGreat blog posts answer readers\u2019 questions as quickly and simply as possible, and your headings and subheadings can help accomplish that. \r\n\r\nThink of them as a continuation of the main idea of your post \u2014 use your subheaders to include keywords and topics that naturally follow your main topic and keyword. \r\n\r\nDon\u2019t add subheaders just for the sake of it. Only include those that address information you know users are looking for as it relates to your topic. \r\n\r\nThe search engine results page (SERP) is a good place to look for cues for what to include in your subheaders. Analyze the top-ranking posts for your keyword and look for any recurring subtopics and headers. \r\n\r\nThis can help reveal what search engines and users deem relevant to the topic at hand and help you further understand the search intent, or the reader\u2019s primary goal when searching for your target keyword. \r\n\r\nFor a deeper dive into how to structure your blog post, head to our <a href=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/creation\/blog-post-templates\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">blog post templates<\/a> resource.\r\n\r\nIt includes eight downloadable templates to help get you started and choose the right blog format for you. \r\n\r\n<h3>5. A Digestible Word Count<\/h3> \r\nPeople want their questions answered and their problems solved, and they wanted it yesterday. \r\n\r\nNothing sends readers running faster than seeing huge walls of text. This isn\u2019t always a hard and fast rule (there are exceptions), but aiming to keep your post around 1,000 words ensures you\u2019re giving readers the information they want as quickly as possible.\r\n \r\nTo keep your word count digestible, you should ruthlessly edit your first draft. Every sentence you write should convey a single idea that builds upon the last. \r\n\r\nCut out any unnecessary words, sentences, or meandering stories that don\u2019t drive the post towards the promise you made in the headline.\r\n\r\n<h3>6. Skimmable Content<\/h3>\r\nWe\u2019ve referred to website visitors as \u201creaders\u201d thus far, but \u201cskimmers\u201d is more fitting. \r\n\r\nIn a perfect world, readers would read every word you publish, but in reality, most people are skimmers. Keeping your content focused, concise, and easy to follow is what keeps your readers moving down the page.\r\n\r\nHere\u2019s how to do it:\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Keep sentences as short as possible (two lines max).<\/li>\r\n<li>Keep paragraphs short \u2014 no more than 4-5 lines per paragraph.<\/li>\r\n<li>Use bulleted lists to break up content (take this one, for example).<\/li> \r\n<li>Add <a href=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/creation\/blog-post-images\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">in-post images<\/a> to keep readers engaged.<\/li>\r\n<li>Speak simply and clearly.<\/li> \r\n<li>Say only what\u2019s absolutely necessary to convey your message.<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\nReaders want specific information and they don\u2019t want to work to get it. When you structure your posts with this in mind, you create clear value that keeps them coming back for more.\r\n\r\n<h3>7. Engaging Visuals<\/h3>\r\nHumans are visual creatures. Breaking up your post with engaging visual elements can level up your content and make it easier for readers to digest.\r\n\r\nMailchimp does this well on their blog: \r\n\r\n<img src=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/08\/screenshot-mailchimp.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1400\" height=\"948\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-29367\" \/>\r\n\r\nYour reader\u2019s attention is a hot commodity, and you\u2019re more likely to capture it when you illustrate your points with interesting graphics.\r\n\r\nSemrush found that articles with over seven images see 116% more organic traffic than those  with none. Providing something to look at besides text gives readers a refreshing visual break that keeps them engaged for longer.\r\n\r\nStock photos and screenshots are a great way to add some visual flair for free. You can find plenty of free options on sites like <a href=\"https:\/\/unsplash.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Unsplash<\/a>, <a href=\"https:\/\/pixabay.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Pixabay<\/a> and <a href=\"https:\/\/gratisography.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Gratisography<\/a>. \r\n\r\n<h4>How To Use Visuals To Improve Rankings<\/h4>\r\n\r\nUtilizing interesting visuals isn\u2019t just a way to make your content engaging and digestible \u2014 it also serves important ranking factors if you execute it properly. \r\n\r\n<div class=\"video-container\"><iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/xJq3RLiifFo\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen><\/iframe><\/div>\r\n\r\nHere\u2019s how to get it right: \r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Compress images as small as possible without sacrificing quality.<\/li>\r\n<li>Use alt text to help Google understand what your post is about.<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\nWhile we recommend utilizing stock photos, we actively avoid choosing \u201coverly stock\u201d photos \u2014 those that feel less polished or unnatural. \r\n\r\nLook for more personal, realistic stock photos with natural lighting and realistic subjects, and add them every three to five paragraphs in your post \u2014 your readers will thank you. \r\n\r\n<img src=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/08\/bad-vs-good-stock-photo.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1400\" height=\"756\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-29363\" \/>\r\n\r\n<h3>8. Strategic Keyword Placement<\/h3> \r\nIf you want your blog post to rank, there are a few keyword optimizations to keep in mind.\r\n\r\nBe sure to include your target keyword in the following places: \r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Towards the front of your post title<\/li> \r\n<li>In your <a href=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/seo\/how-to-create-the-best-url-structures\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">URL structure<\/a><\/li> \r\n<li>In your <a href=\"https:\/\/contentmarketinginstitute.com\/articles\/meta-description-tips\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">meta description<\/a><\/li>\r\n<li>In image alt text<\/li> \r\n<li>Once in your introduction and conclusion<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\nWhile you should be intentionally using your target keyword and its variants throughout your post, avoid keyword stuffing like the plague. \r\n\r\nGreat blog posts prioritize the user above search engine robots \u2014 if it\u2019s not adding value to the reader, get rid of it.\r\n \r\n<h3>9. Relevant Internal Links<\/h3>\r\nInternal linking is one of the most important factors Google uses to rank and index your post. \r\n\r\nAn internal link is a link that connects two pages on your website.\r\n\r\nThere are two ways to utilize internal links: \r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Linking to other posts on your site<\/li>\r\n<li>Linking from other posts on your site to your new post<\/li> \r\n<\/ul>\r\nDon\u2019t just take our word for it \u2014 it\u2019s at the very top of <a href=\"https:\/\/developers.google.com\/search\/docs\/advanced\/guidelines\/webmaster-guidelines?hl=en&visit_id=637672340551369618-789891814&rd=1\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Google\u2019s webmaster guideline<\/a>: \r\n\r\n<b>\u201cEnsure that all pages on the site can be reached by a link from another findable page.\u201d<\/b> \r\n\r\nWe recommend adding at least two to three internal links for every 1000 words, but don\u2019t force links into your post just for the sake of it. \r\n\r\nHere\u2019s how to get the most from your internal linking strategy: \r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Notice where readers would benefit from a deeper-dive into a topic you referenced and have previously written about.<\/li> \r\n<li>Find related posts by doing a site search: \u201cSITE:siegemedia.com internal links.\u201d<\/li> \r\n<li>Use thoughtful anchor text that gives context to the resource you\u2019re linking to.<\/li> \r\n<\/ul>\r\nInternal links are an easy way to keep users engaged and lead them to other content on your site. When done correctly, they also improve your site\u2019s search crawlability, which can lead to better rankings. \r\n\r\nCheck out our interactive <a href=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/strategy\/on-page-seo\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">on-page SEO resource<\/a> for a deeper dive into the most important SEO optimizations you should implement.  \r\n\r\n<h3>10. A Clear Call to Action<\/h3> \r\nA great blog post compels readers to take action. Once someone finishes reading your post, you need to tell them what to do next. \r\n\r\nThe action you want them to take should be tied to your high-level goals, whether that\u2019s conversions, social media shares, or leading them to a relevant blog post. \r\n\r\n<img src=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/08\/cta-image-explanation.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1400\" height=\"805\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-29365\" \/>\r\n\r\nAn effective call to action triggers an emotion and goes back to knowing your target audience. What benefit awaits them if they take action now? How will they feel? \r\n\r\nKeep your reader\u2019s point of view front of mind to motivate them to take action. \r\n\r\n<h3>11. Regular Content Updates<\/h3>\r\nSuccessful blog content doesn\u2019t run on a \u201cset it and forget it\u201d strategy \u2014 if you want to improve your rankings and provide true value to readers, you need to keep your content fresh. \r\n\r\nAnd in some cases, updating older posts should take priority over creating new content, especially if you can execute those updates in a short amount of time. \r\n\r\nSo what does \u201ckeeping content fresh\u201d actually mean? It comes down to a few common problems: \r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Search intent changes over time \u2014 your content that nailed a searcher\u2019s query a year ago might not serve today\u2019s searchers as well.<\/li>\r\n<li>Your post structure is off.<\/li> \r\n<li>Your data findings are no longer the most recent available.<\/li> \r\n<li>You might have broken links in your content.<\/li>   \r\n<li>Your content might no longer be the most comprehensive resource available.<\/li> \r\n<\/ul>\r\nNeed some hard proof that updating stale content can impact rankings? \r\n\r\nCheck out how traffic improved to the Siege Media blog after making some simple post updates, all within the span of a week: \r\n\r\n<img src=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/08\/screenshot-one-week-organic-traffic.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1400\" height=\"415\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-29368\" \/>\r\n\r\nOur <b>organic traffic increased by 52%<\/b> from non-holiday lows, all thanks to some simple post updates. While we can\u2019t guarantee you\u2019ll see the same result, it\u2019s reasonable to expect traffic to increase by around 10-20%. \r\n\r\nSo, how do you know when it's time to update a post? \r\n\r\nWe like to use a rule of thumb called \u201c<a href=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/seo\/freshness-distance\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">freshness distance<\/a>\u201d. \r\n\r\nLook at the first page of the SERP for your keyword, and find the distance between the most recently updated post and the oldest post currently ranking. \r\n\r\nThis distance reveals a lot about what the SERP requires in terms of how frequently updates are needed to stay competitive. \r\n\r\nSay you google your keyword and see that the time distance between the top ranking post and the oldest post is less than a month.\r\n\r\nIf your post on the same topic hasn\u2019t been updated in over a month, it\u2019s unlikely your article is getting clicked. Ultimately, it\u2019ll be pushed farther down on the SERP in favor of more recent articles. \r\n\r\nThat\u2019s just one example. The main takeaway here is to identify the freshness distance of the main search results or topics that you\u2019re trying to compete for. \r\n\r\nThen, define an update schedule based on that and create a regular cadence of updating those pieces. That might be monthly for some posts, and yearly for others \u2014 it depends on what you see in the search results. \r\n\r\nOnce you\u2019ve determined which posts you need to update, here\u2019s where to spend your time when it\u2019s time to give them a lift: \r\n<ul>\r\n<li><b>Facts and data:<\/b> Replace any outdated facts, figures and sources you linked to to reflect the most up-to-date research.<\/li> \r\n<li><b>Dates:<\/b> Update the date in your title, if applicable, and the timestamp on your post.<\/li>\r\n<li><b>Search intent:<\/b> Search intent changes over time, so align your content with the current search intent based on the SERP.<\/li>\r\n<li><b>Broken links:<\/b> Double-check for any internal links that may have broken since you published.<\/li> \r\n<li><b>New linking opportunities:<\/b> Find opportunities to link to newly published content that wasn\u2019t available when you first published.<\/li>\r\n<li><b>Content:<\/b> Can you improve your title? Write a stronger introduction? Revise your post structure to align with what\u2019s ranking now on the SERP? Add a call to action to a new sales page?<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\nRemember, some content might need a major facelift while others just need a 10-minute tweak. \r\n\r\nContent updates are nuanced, so use the SERP as a guide. But don\u2019t just focus on on-page SEO adjustments \u2014 these are crucial, but keep this question front of mind: \r\n\r\nHow can I update this to add the maximum value to the reader? These two go hand in hand. \r\n\r\n<h2>Up and to the Right<\/h2>\r\nCreating a successful blog post might require some thought and effort up front, but the brand visibility, authority, trust, and ultimately conversions, make it a worthwhile endeavor.\r\n\r\nIf you need some extra support learning what makes a good blog post and creating posts that rank, our <a href=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/services\/content-creation\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">content creation services<\/a> are here to help.\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/08\/infographic-what-makes-a-good-blog-post-how-to-create-high-converting-content.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1400\" height=\"6106\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-29366\" \/>\r\n"

To help, we\u2019ve collected 11 types of creative content and explained how you can take these content types to the next level. \r\n\r\n<h2>11 Types of Creative Content<\/h2>\r\nSuccessful brands mix and match the following content types in order to provide comprehensive and creative information for their audience. \r\n\r\n<h3 id=\"blog-post\">1. Blog Post<\/h3>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/08\/creative-content-blog-post.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1400\" height=\"1248\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-29246\" \/>\r\n\r\nA blog post is an informational piece of content that\u2019s hosted on a website. You use this form of media to educate the audience on a top- or middle-funnel topic related to your product or service. \r\n\r\nBlog posts are especially valuable if you\u2019re trying to grow your customer base, as you can target keywords that relate to your offering to <a href=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/creation\/seo-content\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">rank on Google<\/a> and increase traffic to your site. \r\n\r\nAs an SEO content marketing agency, blog posts are our bread and butter. For example, clients like Zola, a wedding planning and registry site, leveled up their blog with posts like <a href=\"https:\/\/www.zola.com\/expert-advice\/free-bridal-shower-printables\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">free bridal shower printables<\/a>, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.zola.com\/expert-advice\/wedding-themes\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">wedding themes<\/a>, and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.zola.com\/expert-advice\/wedding-send-off-ideas\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">wedding send-off ideas<\/a>. \r\n\r\nThese blog posts align with their offering and include new and valuable information, earning them a spot on page one of Google. \r\n\r\n<b>How to make blog posts creative:<\/b>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Create a <a href=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/seo\/post-structure-for-seo\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">user-friendly structure<\/a> that\u2019s designed to answer the query and any follow-up questions as simply as possible.<\/li>\r\n<li>Make it scannable with shorter paragraphs, bulleted lists, bolding, TL;DRs, main takeaways, or tips.<\/li>\r\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/seo\/what-is-eat\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Show your authority<\/a> on the topic and add unique advice based on your experience.<\/li>\r\n<li>Find ways to cater to all four types of learning styles: visual, auditory, reading and writing, and kinesthetic.<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n\r\n<h3 id=\"graphic-design\">2.

However, making beautiful content just for the sake of it can be expensive and won\u2019t lead to the results (traffic, <a href=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/marketing\/cost-per-link-analysis\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">passive links<\/a>, shares, etc.) that you\u2019re looking for. \r\n\r\nTo make the design more valuable, it\u2019s important to pair aesthetically designed icons with actionable information. \r\n\r\nIn this technical post by TurboTenant on \u201c<a href=\"https:\/\/www.turbotenant.com\/blog\/emotional-support-animal-laws\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Emotional Support Animal Laws<\/a>,\u201d the designer mixed cute pet illustrations with important callouts to make creative post images. \r\n\r\n<b>How to make creative graphic design:<\/b>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Look at Google Images for the topic and find ways to level up what\u2019s ranking.<\/li>\r\n<li>Implement an image hierarchy that tells a story.<\/li>\r\n<li>Find ways to explain a complex topic more clearly with your design.<\/li>\r\n<li>Look at what design different industries are sharing.

Photography<\/h3>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/08\/creative-content-photography.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1400\" height=\"1075\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-29255\" \/>\r\n\r\nPhotography is a go-to format for most brands because it allows them to showcase their physical product. Even if they have a service or offering, photography can help them demonstrate how it\u2019s used. \r\n\r\nBrands can choose to create their own custom photography, source user-generated photography, or utilize <a href=\"https:\/\/youtu.be\/xJq3RLiifFo\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">stock imagery<\/a>. \r\n\r\n<h4>Custom Photography<\/h4>\r\nCustom photography allows the brand to have complete creative control over the content. \r\n\r\nThis means they can dictate exactly what products you show, how you display them, what lighting you use, and any other small details that ultimately add to good branding and  brand association. \r\n\r\nA creative marketing example is the custom photography showcased in this post on \u201c<a href=\"https:\/\/www.shutterfly.com\/ideas\/cutting-board-sizes\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Cutting Board Sizes<\/a>\u201d which includes a variety of cutting boards styled in unique ways.\r\n\r\n<h4>User Generated Content (UGC)<\/h4>\r\nPhotos taken by other individuals rather than the brand are considered user-generated content. \r\n\r\nYou can source these from anyone on the internet and <a href=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/creation\/content-curation\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">curate the content<\/a> on your social media platforms or blog. You can also pull from content creators who have tagged your brand on social media platforms. For any UGC photography, we suggest to get explicit permission from the photographer before using them in your branded content.\r\n\r\nUGC is a medium-effort route that can lead to curated examples that are unique and creative. 1st Dibs pairs UGC photography with data in their post on the \"<a href=\"https:\/\/www.1stdibs.com\/blogs\/the-study\/interior-design-trends-2022\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Top Interior Design Trends<\/a>\" for an inventive and informative combination. \r\n\r\n<h4>Stock Photography<\/h4>\r\nStock photography is a lower-effort option, but to make it creative the brand will typically need to add some kind of value. \r\n\r\nFor example, <a href=\"https:\/\/solo.co\/blog\/category\/starting-a-business\/1\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Solo Global<\/a> mixes stock photography with graphic design to create branded images on their blog. Even the pure stock imagery they use highlights their main brand color in a way that feels cohesive with the rest of their content. \r\n\r\n<b>How to make photography creative:<\/b>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Showcase your product or service in a new way with custom photography.<\/li> \r\n<li>Utilize UGC by sourcing photos and curating unique examples that aren\u2019t shown by other companies.<\/li> \r\n<li>Find ways to add value to make your version more branded if using stock imagery.<\/li>  \r\n<\/ul>\r\n\r\n<h3 id=\"animation\">4.

A little movement can go a long way when it comes to catching a reader\u2019s attention. If you want to improve upon your current content design, try adding animation. \r\n\r\nDepending on your budget, this animation could be high effort or low.\r\n\r\nFor example, a low-effort animation might be a post image that features some movement. In this post by Ness on \u201c<a href=\"https:\/\/www.nesswell.com\/how-to-relax-your-jaw\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">How to Relax Your Jaw<\/a>,\u201d post images demonstrate different jaw exercises. This topic can be difficult to explain with words or static images, so a small animation goes a long way. \r\n\r\nA higher-effort animation will be more complex in size and movement. This animated infographic on \u201c<a href=\"https:\/\/www.bigrentz.com\/blog\/city-of-the-future#infographic\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Constructing the City of the Future<\/a>\u201d by BigRentz brings a futuristic city to life in a way that copy alone could not. The more engaging animation is, the more likely people are to stay on your site longer or share.\r\n<ul>\r\n<b>How to make animations creative:<\/b>\r\n<li>Be sure to animate the most confusing or complicated element. What can\u2019t be explained with words or a static image?<\/li>\r\n<li>Start small \u2013 too much animation can take away from the point you\u2019re trying to portray.<\/li>\r\n<li>Find inspiration from the videos ranking for your topic on YouTube.<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n\r\n<h3 id=\"video\">5.

In fact, it\u2019s the most popular content format, with <a href=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/strategy\/content-marketing-statistics\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">59% of content marketers using video<\/a>. \r\n\r\n<a href=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/services\/san-diego-video-production\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Video content<\/a> can rank on search engines and capture the attention of visual learners. Depending on your vertical, the type of videos you create will vary. \r\n\r\nFor example, a diamond expert might decide to focus on product comparisons such as The Diamond Pro does in this video on \u201c<a href=\"https:\/\/www.diamonds.pro\/education\/platinum-vs-gold\/#Platinum-vs-White-Gold-Price\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Platinum vs. White Gold Jewelry<\/a>.\u201d\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, someone in the finance industry might not be able to do a product comparison but can explain a complex topic with an animated video.

These are step-by-step videos that explain a process. For example, FTD, a flower and plant delivery brand, created a video on \u201c<a href=\"https:\/\/www.ftd.com\/blog\/create\/macrame-plant-hanger\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">How to Macrame a Plant Hanger<\/a>\u201d and \u201c<a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=fWYN0FMzpd4&t=1s\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">How to Make a Hanging Centerpiece<\/a>\u201d so their audience could display their products in a new way. \r\n\r\n<b>How to make videos creative:<\/b>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Utilize an expert in the space that can speak to your product or offering in a new or authoritative way.<\/li> \r\n<li>Use videos to further explain the core concepts in your industry.<\/li>  \r\n<li>Create a simple step-by-step process that\u2019s easy to understand and recreate to showcase new ways to use your product.<\/li>  \r\n<li>Repurpose video content to highlight on your website, in blog posts, on YouTube, and on social media.<\/li>  \r\n<\/ul>\r\n\r\n<h3 id=\"interactive\">6.

The rise in popularity of podcasts over the last couple of years has a lot of brands considering this format. \r\n\r\nPodcasts are great for those who want to build credibility by interviewing experts in their industry or giving tips on a given topic. They are not as successful if they lack structure and consistency or try to describe something that would be better as a visual. \r\n\r\nIf you\u2019ve read this far, you\u2019re likely interested in learning more about content marketing.\r\n\r\nAuditory learners may benefit from <a href=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/creation\/content-marketing-podcasts\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">content marketing podcasts<\/a> where titans of the industry discuss trends or best practices.\r\n\r\nWe have one of those ourselves, if you like <a href=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/category\/conversation\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">podcast episodes on all-things content marketing and SEO<\/a>, take a listen. \r\n\r\n<b>How to make podcasts creative:<\/b> \r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Have a strong understanding of your audience and address their needs and concerns.<\/li> \r\n<li>Be consistent about the day you release your podcast and its branding so the audience knows what to expect.<\/li> \r\n<li>Invite new credible guests that haven\u2019t been interviewed on other podcasts.<\/li> \r\n<li>Do your research ahead of time to find out what topics your guest has talked about in the past and make an effort to ask unique questions.<\/li> \r\n<\/ul>\r\n\r\n<h3 id=\"newsletter\">8.

What content do they include? What made you open this one and not the others? Use these questions to help you craft your own brand\u2019s newsletter. \r\n\r\nIf you\u2019re nothing like me and have the healthy practice of unsubscribing, we\u2019ve listed some innovative newsletters in the content marketing space below that you might want to try out. \r\n\r\n<b>How to make newsletters creative:<\/b>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Create a consistent publishing structure so the user knows what to expect.<\/li>\r\n<li>Add clear CTA buttons throughout the newsletter to make the information easy for the audience to interact with.<\/li> \r\n<li>Include a mix of media types including, photos, graphic design, and videos.<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n\r\n<h3 id=\"webinar\">9.

This is a great way to showcase your team\u2019s knowledge as well as connect in real-time with an audience through a Q&A. \r\n\r\n<a href=\"https:\/\/www.clearscope.io\/blog\/why-you-shouldnt-manual-link-build-webinar\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Clearscope<\/a>, a content optimization tool company, does an excellent job of hosting relevant speakers in a webinar format. They discuss the different facets of content optimization with experts in the industry.\r\n\r\nA perk of this format is that you can record the webinar and repurpose the information in other formats such as blog posts or social media posts. You can also include it your company newsletter. \r\n\r\n<b>How to make webinars creative:<\/b>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Make it interactive by finding ways to involve the audience. This is an opportunity to interact with your audience, not just lecture them.<\/li> \r\n<li>Invite unique speakers and guests who will ask interesting questions.<\/li> \r\n<li>Repurpose the learnings or video recording and promote across other platforms.<\/li>\r\n<\/ul> \r\n\r\n<h3 id=\"eBook\">10. eBook<\/h3>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/08\/big-rentz-crane-rental-guide.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1400\" height=\"753\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-29374\" \/>\r\n\r\nDo you have a topic related to your brand that needs to be covered in-depth? If a scannable blog post won\u2019t do the trick, turn to the more comprehensive eBook format. \r\n\r\nAn ebook can be downloaded and consumed by readers at their own speed, and they tend to be longer than classic blog posts because their audience expects a more of an explanation.\r\n\r\nTypically, this content is free, but brands require an email signup to view the eBook. This trade-off is a win-win for both parties, especially the brand who is able to grow their email list with qualified leads. \r\n\r\nIn the construction industry, BigRentz provides its audience with equipment rental eBook guides such as <a href=\"https:\/\/www.bigrentz.com\/dumpster-rental-guide-ebook\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Dumpster Rental Guide<\/a> and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.bigrentz.com\/crane-rental-guide-ebook\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Crane Rental Guide<\/a>. \r\n\r\nAt Siege Media, we have condensed some of our knowledge into <a href=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/downloads\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">content marketing eBooks<\/a> such as \u201cHow to Increase Website Traffic by 250,000+ Monthly Visits\u201d and \u201cHow to Estimate SEO ROI From Content Marketing.\u201d\r\n\r\n<b>How to make eBooks creative:<\/b>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Use unique examples throughout to truly showcase all sides of the topic.<\/li> \r\n<li>Mix in some visuals to break up the copy.<\/li>\r\n<\/ul> \r\n\r\n<h3 id=\"case-study\">11.

Brands use case studies to showcase everything that they can do for a customer by highlighting specific scenarios they\u2019ve encountered and dealt with successfully. \r\n\r\nCase studies are an opportunity to show off your team\u2019s skills to build credibility.\r\n\r\nMost brands have this hosted on a webpage that\u2019s separate from their blog, but you can also promote them on a blog or social media. Case studies usually include a mix of design, data, graphs, video testimonial, and copy. \r\n\r\nYou\u2019ll typically find case studies in the B2B space because businesses want to see how other businesses have performed with the offering. \r\n\r\nSiege Media has a <a href=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/work\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">case study section<\/a> on the site that showcases our creative work (copy, design, development) for clients and its success. This allows interested companies to see what we can potentially do for them. \r\n\r\nB2C companies tend to have review pages rather than case studies because potential consumers want to see what past consumers have to say. \r\n\r\n<b>How to make case studies creative:<\/b>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Be sure to show how your product or service can solve the problem at hand better than your competitor.<\/li>\r\n<li>Include data that backs up any of your claims.<\/li> \r\n<li>Add quotes from those involved in the scenario.<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n\r\n<h2>Places to Find Creative Content Inspiration<\/h2>\r\nWe\u2019ve all had that \u201cstaring at a blank page not knowing what to write\u201d moment. In fact, content marketers are all too familiar with this feeling. \r\n\r\nIf you\u2019re ever unsure of where to start or how to make your content more creative, try using these sources of inspiration below or visit our post on <a href=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/strategy\/content-marketing-examples\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">content marketing examples in action<\/a>.\r\n\r\n<h3>Pinterest<\/h3>\r\nPinterest is a visual platform so it\u2019s easy to scan through examples from your topic. As you\u2019re looking through, notice what stands out to you. Is there a way to combine a few ideas showcased on your Pinterest feed? Organize your ideas with Pinterest boards. \r\n\r\n<h3>Reddit<\/h3> \r\nReddit is a great resource for finding ideas to improve upon industry-specific topics. \r\n\r\nThere are two primary ways to utilize Reddit.\r\n\r\nFirst, you can browse subreddits that tend to share more creative content types.\r\n\r\nFor example, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Infographics\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">\/r\/infographics<\/a>, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/coolguides\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">\/r\/coolguides<\/a>, or  <a href=\"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/dataisbeautiful\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">\/r\/dataisbeautiful<\/a> all feature content across all industries. Maybe someone in a different industry is using a concept that you can implement into your content.\r\n\r\nIf you\u2019re interested in finding inspiration in your own industry, you can look at <a href=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/marketing\/popular-subreddits-by-industry\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">popular subreddits by industry<\/a>. \r\n\r\n<h3>Google Trends<\/h3>\r\nKeep up with the trends in your industry with <a href=\"https:\/\/trends.google.com\/trends\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Google Trends<\/a>. Start by searching for a broad topic and then dive into the subcategories that the platform suggests. Is there something valuable you can add to a new topic that\u2019s trending?\r\n\r\n<h3>Newsletters<\/h3>\r\nSubscribing to newsletters from the marketing or design industry can help inspire your content. Some that we recommend include:\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.us11.list-manage.com\/subscribe?u=1011fe9a05914d2370e0cce10&id=c3f01bd454\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Above the Fold<\/a>\r\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/pudding.cool\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">The Pudding<\/a><\/li>\r\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/carney.co\/daily-carnage\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">The Daily Carnage<\/a><\/li>\r\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/www.morningbrew.com\/daily\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">The Morning Brew<\/a><\/li>\r\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/explodingtopics.com\/newsletter\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Exploding Topics<\/a><\/li>\r\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/www.animalz.co\/newsletter\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Animalz<\/a><\/li>\r\n<li><a href=\"http:\/\/newsletters.creativemornings.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Creative Mornings<\/a><\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n\r\n<h3>Industry Reports<\/h3>\r\nIndustry reports by authorities in your niche can provide a trove of valuable information. You can often subscribe to industry reports, so you\u2019re the first to be notified when this data is released. \r\n\r\nSome examples of industry reports include:\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Lifestyle: <a href=\"https:\/\/business.pinterest.com\/en\/pinterest-predicts\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Pinterest Trend Report<\/a><\/li>\r\n<li>Lifestyle: <a href=\"https:\/\/www.etsy.com\/seller-handbook\/article\/marketplace-insights-early-2022-trends\/1060546536815\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Etsy Trend Reports<\/a><\/li>\r\n<li>Insurance: <a href=\"https:\/\/www.mckinsey.com\/industries\/financial-services\/our-insights\/creating-value-finding-focus-global-insurance-report-2022\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">McKinsey & Company Global Insurance Report<\/a><\/li>\r\n<li>Small Business\/Career: <a href=\"https:\/\/www.bls.gov\/ooh\/media-and-communication\/reporters-correspondents-and-broadcast-news-analysts.htm\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Bureau of Labor Statistics<\/a><\/li>\r\n<li>Science: <a href=\"https:\/\/www.pewresearch.org\/topic\/science\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Pew Research Center<\/a><\/li>\r\n<li>Real Estate: <a href=\"https:\/\/www.nar.realtor\/research-and-statistics\/research-reports\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">NAR Reports<\/a><\/li>\r\n<li>Real Estate: <a href=\"https:\/\/www.corelogic.com\/find\/housing-trends\/configurable-reports-by-dqnews\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">CoreLogic<\/a><\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n\r\n<h3>Designers<\/h3>\r\nGet inspiration from other creatives on social media or Dribble.

If you\u2019re in a fast-moving niche where things can change every few months, or there is a lot of competition, consider revising your content every three to five months. \r\n\r\n<img src=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/08\/ymyl-seo-refresh-your-content-annually.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1400\" height=\"1105\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-29279\" \/>\r\n\r\nIf refreshing your content is daunting or you are on a small team with limited bandwidth, start small. \r\n\r\nFocus on updating titles, metadata, and your headers. Then, once you have more data on your content, work on updating flow, graphics\/images, and overall user experience.\r\n\r\nWe always recommend refreshing poorly performing content, but refreshing your most popular, high-performing content is just as important. \r\n\r\n<img src=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/08\/SEO_pro-tip.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1400\" height=\"701\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-29343\" \/>\r\n\r\n<h3>Showcase Expertise, Authority, and Trustworthiness<\/h3>\r\nAlthough E-A-T is not a direct ranking factor, it plays a major role in whether or not your content will rank. \r\n\r\nImportant for all types of content, E-A-T is especially important for YMYL.

    "content": "As much as we want to pick a favorite e-commerce platform, like most things, it depends.\r\n\r\nWhether you\u2019re just getting started or looking to improve performance and increase your online presence, choosing an e-commerce platform is one of the most important decisions to make for your business.\r\n\r\nWhy?\r\n\r\nIt is the beating heart of your business and what users interact with everyday. It should be easy to use, quick to navigate, and offer expansion options for when you\u2019re ready to upgrade.\r\n\r\nSo, who wins the best e-commerce platform? The TL;DR is: It depends. Shopify wins for ease of use, while WordPress wins for flexibility.\r\n\r\nSiege has utilized WordPress for nearly a decade on our own website and client sites, building out <a href=\"\/creation\/interactive-content\">interactive assets<\/a> and <a href=\"\/services\/blog-design\">blog redesigns<\/a> to improve conversions and performance.\r\n\r\nHowever, making a decision on your content management system (CMS) is no one-size-fits-all approach \u2014 it\u2019s more complicated than that.\r\n\r\nWith that being said, it\u2019s important to understand the pros and cons of each platform to understand which one is best for your business.\r\n\r\nRead on to understand how we came to our conclusion.\r\n<h2>What is WordPress?<\/h2>\r\nWordPress just turned 19 years old, which means it\u2019s some of the oldest technology on the modern internet. While its roots may run deep, the open source team behind the software keeps pushing forward to make it the best CMS for individuals and businesses of all types.\r\n<blockquote class=\"definition\">According to <a href=\"https:\/\/w3techs.com\/technologies\/overview\/content_management\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">W3Techs<\/a>, <strong>WordPress powers 43% of all sites<\/strong> on the internet.<\/blockquote>\r\n<h3>Pros and Cons of WordPress<\/h3>\r\n<h4>Pros<\/h4>\r\n<ul>\r\n \t<li>Easily launch a new site with lots of features on a budget<\/li>\r\n \t<li>Lots of available resources to help with any issues<\/li>\r\n \t<li>Drag-and-drop website builder<\/li>\r\n \t<li>A multitude of options for additional features<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n<h4>Cons<\/h4>\r\n<ul>\r\n \t<li>Frequent manual updates and maintenance can be bothersome<\/li>\r\n \t<li>Optimizing for best performance can be tricky<\/li>\r\n \t<li>Added functionality can cost significantly more than the base system<\/li>\r\n \t<li>Plugins required for e-commerce functionality<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n<img src=\"\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/07\/pros-and-cons-of-wordpress.png\" alt=\"Pros and cons of WordPress\" \/>\r\n<h2>What is Shopify?<\/h2>\r\nShopify is also pretty old, having been launched in 2006. It is a dedicated e-commerce platform with everything a modern business needs to start selling online quickly. With one quick signup, you can:\r\n<ul>\r\n \t<li>Buy a domain name<\/li>\r\n \t<li>Configure your website<\/li>\r\n \t<li>Add products to sell<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\nThere\u2019s no hosting decision, no complicated procedures to synchronize your domain to your website, and virtually no technical hurdles to jump.\r\n<blockquote class=\"definition\"><a href=\"https:\/\/backlinko.com\/shopify-stores\">1.75 million merchants<\/a> sell using the Shopify platform.<\/blockquote>\r\n<h3>Pros and Cons of Shopify<\/h3>\r\n<h4>Pros<\/h4>\r\n<ul>\r\n \t<li>Fully managed platform frees you to run your business<\/li>\r\n \t<li>Built-in payment system<\/li>\r\n \t<li>Inventory management<\/li>\r\n \t<li>Built-in marketing tools, such as follow-up and abandoned cart emails<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n<h4>Cons<\/h4>\r\n<ul>\r\n \t<li>Apps can add significant monthly cost<\/li>\r\n \t<li>Limited blogging capabilities<\/li>\r\n \t<li>Harder to migrate away once established<\/li>\r\n \t<li>Limited theme and add-on app selection<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n<img src=\"\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/07\/pros-and-cons-of-shopify.png\" alt=\"Pros and cons of Shopify\" \/>\r\n<h2>How To Choose an E-Commerce Platform<\/h2>\r\nBefore choosing the best e-commerce platform for you, it\u2019s necessary to ask yourself the following questions:\r\n<ul>\r\n \t<li>What is your budget?<\/li>\r\n \t<li>What should the website look like?<\/li>\r\n \t<li>Do you need to add functionality with plugins or apps?<\/li>\r\n \t<li>What is your technical expertise?<\/li>\r\n \t<li>Will you require customer support?<\/li>\r\n \t<li>How much customization do you want?<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n\r\n<blockquote class=\"definition\">Want to learn more about e-commerce marketing?

However, it\u2019s always going to cost some money to create a site.\r\n\r\nBudget hosting is fine for an information site just starting out, but businesses with serious aspirations should look to higher tiers for best performance. Why? In the e-commerce world, performance equals sales.\r\n<ul>\r\n \t<li>WordPress standard hosting cost = $3 - $15<\/li>\r\n \t<li>WordPress managed hosting cost = $25 - $500<\/li>\r\n \t<li>E-commerce plugins subject to additional costs<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\nYes, in general, managed hosting is more expensive, but what you get in return has a tangible benefit: the software is optimized for their servers and usually includes a list of helpful features, like backup\/restore functions and global content delivery networks.\r\n<h4>Shopify<\/h4>\r\nOn Shopify there\u2019s no difference between their lowest and highest priced tiers in terms of performance. All sites run on the same highly optimized global network.\r\n\r\nThe main differences are in the transaction fees you\u2019ll pay and the higher shipping discounts in the upper tiers.\r\n<ul>\r\n \t<li>Apps can add significant monthly cost<\/li>\r\n \t<li>Expert developers may cost more than WordPress developers<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n<h4 class=\"color-red\">Winner<\/h4>\r\nThis was a close call, but in the end, WordPress wins this category due to freedom of choice \u2014 an optimal choice for e-commerce platforms:\r\n<ul>\r\n \t<li>Choice of hosting to fit your budget and specs<\/li>\r\n \t<li>Choice of payment processor<\/li>\r\n \t<li>Choice of shipping provider<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n<img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-29078\" src=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/07\/wordpress-vs-shopify-budget.png\" alt=\"WordPress beats Shopify in the Budget category\" width=\"1400\" height=\"548\" \/>\r\n<h3>Themes<\/h3>\r\nWhile the performance and content of your website are key factors to your site's success, the layout and design is the first impression.\r\n\r\nThemes are files that form the look and feel of your website and ultimately influences the likelihood of the user staying on your site.\r\n<h4>WordPress<\/h4>\r\nPlain and simple: There are a <a href=\"https:\/\/wordpress.org\/themes\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">multitude of free<\/a> and commercial themes available for WordPress, which makes it a great resource in this category.\r\n\r\nAt the time of publication, WordPress has over 9,800 free themes available. You can find themes that target nearly any industry, as well as general purpose themes that you can customize to your heart\u2019s content.\r\n\r\nIt\u2019s not an exaggeration to state that availability of themes is one of the biggest reasons why WordPress is so popular.\r\n\r\nSpeaking of customization, most themes allow at least some customization, whether selecting different fonts, colors, or layouts. For WordPress, all of that comes in an easy to use dashboard.\r\n<h4>Shopify<\/h4>\r\nShopify has a much smaller <a href=\"https:\/\/themes.shopify.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">catalog of free and commercial themes<\/a>.\r\n\r\nAlthough Shopify themes don't offer as much customization as WordPress, it won\u2019t be difficult to select a base theme and make it unique to your brand.\r\n\r\nHowever, there are many businesses that exist to help you customize your theme or develop one from the ground up. This is a disadvantage, since it requires a developer to create a theme to match your brand. Plus, it adds cost to get your business running.\r\n\r\nUltimately, the quality of the existing themes is just as good as WordPress and will likely suit your needs as you get established if you decide to go this route.\r\n<h4 class=\"color-red\">Winner<\/h4>\r\nIn the end, WordPress takes the cake in this category due to the sheer volume of choice.\r\n\r\n<img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-29085\" src=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/07\/wordpress-vs-shopify-themes.png\" alt=\"WordPress beats Shopify in the Themes category\" width=\"1400\" height=\"548\" \/>\r\n<h3>Plugins and Apps<\/h3>\r\nPlugins are a necessity in website development and extend the functionality of the core system beyond its initial purpose.\r\n\r\nFor WordPress and Shopify, plugins make it easy to add advanced features to set your business apart or improve the experience your customers have when visiting your site.\r\n<h4>WordPress Plugins<\/h4>\r\nWhen WordPress launched their plugin system in 2004, it was the start of a new era for the CMS. Some of the first commercial plugins for WordPress were for <a href=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/strategy\/ecommerce-content-marketing\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">e-commerce sites<\/a>, so this is a long-established and respected category for them.\r\n\r\nIn WordPress, plugins can supplement \u2018normal\u2019 website functionality with things like:\r\n<ul>\r\n \t<li><a href=\"https:\/\/wordpress.org\/plugins\/bbpress\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Forums<\/a><\/li>\r\n \t<li><a href=\"https:\/\/wordpress.org\/plugins\/buddypress\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Social network<\/a><\/li>\r\n \t<li><a href=\"https:\/\/wordpress.org\/plugins\/search\/lms\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Learning portals<\/a><\/li>\r\n \t<li>Replace built-in functions, such as search<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\nThe most popular e-commerce plugins for WordPress include:\r\n<ul>\r\n \t<li><a href=\"https:\/\/woocommerce.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">WooCommerce<\/a>: The leader from the company behind WordPress<\/li>\r\n \t<li><a href=\"https:\/\/wordpress.org\/plugins\/bbpress\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Easy Digital Downloads<\/a>: The best for selling ebooks, software, or music<\/li>\r\n \t<li><a href=\"https:\/\/www.wpeasycart.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">WP EasyCart<\/a>: The upstart all-in-one solution<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\nFrom a technical perspective, plugins run within WordPress itself.\r\n\r\n<b>Advantages of the WordPress plugin system:<\/b>\r\n<ul>\r\n \t<li>Tight integration with the core system<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n<b>Disadvantages of the WordPress plugin system:<\/b>\r\n<ul>\r\n \t<li>Poorly coded plugins can crash the whole site<\/li>\r\n \t<li>Historically, the cause of most WordPress site problems<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n<h4>Shopify Apps<\/h4>\r\nShopify has apps that are like WordPress plugins, as they extend the functionality of your site.\r\n\r\nSome examples of apps for Shopify are:\r\n<ul>\r\n \t<li>Recommendation and review systems<\/li>\r\n \t<li>Subscription orders<\/li>\r\n \t<li>Social media feeds<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\nApps typically run outside the Shopify platform. Just like WordPress plugins, they can tap into pages and users, but also products and orders.\r\n\r\nHowever, unlike WordPress plugins, they don\u2019t run within the platform.\r\n\r\nAdvantages of this approach:\r\n<ul>\r\n \t<li>Clear separation of the core system and apps<\/li>\r\n \t<li>Won\u2019t crash the site if faulty<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\nDisadvantages of Shopify apps:\r\n<ul>\r\n \t<li>Difficult for developers<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\nMany apps charge high monthly fees, whereas the typical WordPress plugin is a one-time purchase.\r\n<h4 class=\"color-red\">Winner<\/h4>\r\nWordPress wins again for volume and diversity of choice. If you want to easily add functionality to your site, there is most likely a plugin to suit your needs.\r\n\r\n<img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-29080\" src=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/07\/wordpress-vs-shopify-plugins.png\" alt=\"WordPress beats Shopify in the Plugins category\" width=\"1400\" height=\"548\" \/>\r\n<h3>Technical Matters<\/h3>\r\nDo you have the inclination to manage your website? If you\u2019re the curious type and want to learn more about running your own site, this is a good way to get started.\r\n<h4>WordPress<\/h4>\r\nIf managing your website is ideal, WordPress may be a good choice for you. You\u2019ll get experience installing and updating plugins, configuring the theme, and optimizing the site for performance.\r\n<h4>Shopify<\/h4>\r\nIf you\u2019d rather just manage your business and sales, Shopify is the better option.\r\n\r\nOnce you configure your theme, you\u2019re all set to start promotion and start selling your products. All the technical considerations are handled by the experts at Shopify.\r\n<h4 class=\"color-red\">Winner<\/h4>\r\nShopify wins this category because they manage all aspects of the platform, from the software to the network \u2014 easy peasy.\r\n\r\nIf you\u2019d rather leave the details to the experts, <a href=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/business-form\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">contact us to help<\/a> with your website today.\r\n\r\n<img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-29084\" src=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/07\/wordpress-vs-shopify-technical-matters.png\" alt=\"Shopify beats WordPress in the Technical Matters category\" width=\"1400\" height=\"548\" \/>\r\n<h3>Support<\/h3>\r\nRunning an online business can be technically challenging, so there may come a time when you need help.\r\n<h4>WordPress<\/h4>\r\nThe open-source nature of WordPress means you generally have to rely on information from your developer or online sources.\r\n\r\nIf you do this yourself, this takes away time from running your business. Otherwise, you\u2019ll have to hire someone to make changes.\r\n<h4>Shopify<\/h4>\r\nShopify support is available 24\/7 to help with any problems in your store.\r\n\r\nThis might be something as simple as adjusting an option in your theme or more challenging issues such as inventory management. Your monthly fee helps cover any problem you may have.\r\n<h4 class=\"color-red\">Winner<\/h4>\r\nShopify triumphs again with on-call support staff. With one call or chat, you can resolve most problems quickly. Forget the endless searches and trial and error changes and get straight to the solution.\r\n\r\n<img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-29083\" src=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/07\/wordpress-vs-shopify-support.png\" alt=\"Shopify beats WordPress in the Support category\" width=\"1400\" height=\"548\" \/>\r\n<h3>Customization<\/h3>\r\nYou want your website to mesh with the rest of your brand identity, right?\r\n\r\nCustomization refers to the process of adjusting options for your website to make it yours.\r\n<h4>WordPress<\/h4>\r\nWhile both platforms allow customization, WordPress is the clear winner here.\r\n\r\nNot only does the system encourage plugins to alter functionality, there are tons of global developers ready to take on your project. The WordPress ecosystem is so large as to <a href=\"https:\/\/wpengine.com\/blog\/wordpress-economy-drives-more-than-half-a-trillion-in-revenue-new-global-study\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">dwarf the economies of small countries<\/a>.\r\n<h4>Shopify<\/h4>\r\nThe options for customization on Shopify are a bit more limited.\r\n\r\nIt kind of makes sense since a lot of functionality is built into the core platform. That said, customizing your store\u2019s theme is a great way to stand out and is an easy task for developers and non-developers alike.\r\n<h4 class=\"color-red\">Winner<\/h4>\r\nIf it wasn\u2019t clear yet that WordPress equals choice, here we have another example.\r\n\r\nIt\u2019s important to note that the best way to get exactly what you want is to hire an agency with the resources to make a great looking website, and also have it perform its best. <a href=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/business-form\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">We\u2019re here to help when you\u2019re ready<\/a>.\r\n\r\n<img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-29079\" src=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/07\/wordpress-vs-shopify-customization.png\" alt=\"WordPress beats Shopify in the Customization category\" width=\"1400\" height=\"548\" \/>\r\n<h3>Don't Forget: Site and Data Security<\/h3>\r\nIt\u2019s a no-brainer that customer data should be secure, right? Additionally, you don\u2019t want to be a victim of hackers exploiting your site to serve malware.\r\n\r\nThat\u2019s where the security consideration comes into play.\r\n<h4>WordPress<\/h4>\r\nEven though WordPress is notorious for security breaches, did you know that most of these problems are in plugins?\r\n\r\nThe core system, while resilient against attacks, is not very useful without plugins to enable e-commerce functionality.\r\n\r\nOnce you add an e-commerce plugin and start accepting payments, you open your site up to potential bad actors. Then, you have to add plugins for security, spam protection, and logging. All those plugins add up in potential cost increases and performance decreases.\r\n\r\nThere are several well-respected security plugins to help protect your site against hackers. Our favorites:\r\n<ul>\r\n \t<li><a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordfence.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Wordfence<\/a><\/li>\r\n \t<li><a href=\"https:\/\/akismet.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Akismet<\/a><\/li>\r\n \t<li><a href=\"https:\/\/www.cloudflare.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Cloudfare<\/a><\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n<h4>Shopify<\/h4>\r\nShopify has you covered with secure payment processing. They also work hard to ensure that hackers cannot access your customer\u2019s personal data.\r\n<h4 class=\"color-red\">Winner<\/h4>\r\nShopify prevails again in this department. While WordPress gives you choice, this is one area where lack of choice is a good thing \u2014 Shopify just does it right.\r\n\r\n<img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-29082\" src=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/07\/wordpress-vs-shopify-security.png\" alt=\"Shopify beats WordPress in the Security category\" width=\"1400\" height=\"548\" \/>\r\n<h2>Other Platforms to Consider<\/h2>\r\nThere are several alternatives to each platform, depending on your needs.\r\n\r\nFor example, if you have experienced developers that are more productive with other platforms, then selecting one of these platforms may not make sense for you.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, if you have hundreds of thousands \u2014 or even millions \u2014 of pieces of content, these platforms may not offer acceptable performance.\r\n\r\nCompeting with WordPress for pure CMS market share is <a href=\"https:\/\/www.drupal.org\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Drupal<\/a> and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.joomla.org\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Joomla<\/a>, though each has seen their user numbers decline in recent years.\r\n\r\nMany lesser-known platforms are in the process of dying off, while others compete to take market share from the leader \u2014 WordPress.\r\n\r\nYou may have already heard of Squarespace, but did you know that they aren\u2019t the only all-in-one solution? There\u2019s also <a href=\"https:\/\/webflow.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Webflow<\/a>, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wix.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Wix<\/a>, and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.weebly.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Weebly<\/a>, which all include e-commerce, blogging, and information site features.\r\n\r\nOther possible reasons to consider other platforms:\r\n<ul>\r\n \t<li>Enhanced security requirements - Drupal<\/li>\r\n \t<li>More options for user permissions - Joomla<\/li>\r\n \t<li>Complex content types and relationships - Drupal and Joomla<\/li>\r\n \t<li>Simple site publishing - Weebly and Wix<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n<h2>Our Winner: WordPress<\/h2>\r\n<img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-29081\" src=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/07\/wordpress-vs-shopify-scorecard.png\" alt=\"WordPress beats Shopify in this comparison\" width=\"1400\" height=\"1251\" \/>\r\n\r\nFor ultimate flexibility, WordPress is the clear choice.\r\n\r\nIf you already use WordPress for your website, consider adding an e-commerce plugin to scale your business significantly .\r\n\r\nIf you\u2019re just starting out, choosing an all-in-one platform like Shopify can get you selling in no time. Start with their free trial to gauge its workflow and whether the available themes fit your brand.\r\n\r\nWhichever platform you choose, we can help <a href=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/services\/graphic-design\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">design<\/a>, <a href=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/services\/blog-design\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">develop<\/a>, and <a href=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/services\/seo\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">optimize<\/a> your online presence."

    "title": "What Is Digital PR? 7 Steps for Creating a Winning Campaign",
    "content": "According to Aristotle, the foundation of persuasive communication is credibility, reason, and emotion. A lot has changed since 322 BC, but this definition still holds up in PR. \r\n\r\nIn recent years, Google\u2019s ranking algorithm has become more brand-centric and stricter in defining a quality link. \r\n\r\nTo rank in 2022, you need <a href=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/seo\/content-strategy\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">quality SEO content<\/a> that reputable publications want to link to because it\u2019s unique and fulfills a need. Attaching a high volume of links to low-quality content doesn\u2019t get the job done anymore. \r\n\r\nSo how can you build your brand in a reputable way that appeals to both humans and search engines? \r\n\r\nThe answer: Digital PR.\r\n\r\n<b>Digital PR<\/b>, like traditional PR, is a strategic way to control how the public perceives your brand. \r\n\r\nWith the majority of news and information being consumed online, it\u2019s natural that PR has entered the search landscape, bringing with it some traditional PR techniques like relationship building and the cold email. \r\n\r\nBut what\u2019s the role of digital PR in SEO?\r\n\r\nThe truth is that digital PR isn\u2019t an SEO concept at all, but rather a brand reputation technique with major SEO upsides. \r\n\r\nDigital PR agencies blend traditional PR with SEO by helping get content to high-DA publications, thus resulting in quality backlinks, more passive links, and <a href=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/seo\/link-building-cost\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">less money spent on traditional link building<\/a>. \r\n\r\nKeep reading as we break down what digital PR is and isn\u2019t, how you can create a campaign that drives major results, and some examples of successful digital PR in action. \r\n\r\n<h2>What Is Digital PR?<\/h2>\r\nDigital PR is a marketing technique to enhance a brand\u2019s reputation and increase its visibility online. The practice is typically done by creating topical content and pitching it to journalists and bloggers in relevant media outlets. \r\n\r\nFinding ways to speak directly to your target audience is key for building brand identity, but a difficult process to nail. \r\n\r\nThrough digital PR, brands work to create relationships with journalists and publications that speak directly to their consumers. This way, brands can build a following by funneling their content through popular and relevant news outlets.\r\n\r\nIf this sounds like traditional PR to you, that\u2019s because it is. But since it exists online, it has search implications that can help you increase both brand and non-brand traffic. \r\n\r\nYou can build trust with Google the same way you would with the general public. If news outlets reference and link to your content, Google will begin to view your site as an authoritative voice in the industry and, as a result, rank you higher. \r\n\r\nHowever, it\u2019s here where the lines begin to get blurred between digital PR and link building.\r\n\r\n<h2>Digital PR Is Not Link Building<\/h2>\r\nThe simplest way to differentiate the two is by looking at the content\u2019s purpose. \r\n\r\nLink builders have traditionally had one thing in mind: <b>building a lot of links in order to impress Google<\/b>. \r\n\r\nDigital PR, on the other hand, is more concerned with promoting content that serves a human purpose and will therefore naturally accumulate backlinks.\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/07\/digital-pr-strategy-vs-link-building-strategy.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1400\" height=\"882\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-29096\" \/>\r\n\r\nLink building exists within the larger scope of digital PR, but is an organic part of the process, rather than the main function. In other words, digital PR prioritizes content that will link passively over time, instead of content that requires manual outreach to succeed. \r\n\r\nWe learned this from experience here at Siege. After sending over \u200b\u200b<a href=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/marketing\/manual-link-building\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">one million outreach emails<\/a>, we realized that traditional link building done through manual outreach didn\u2019t make sense for most of our clients. \r\n\r\nThe ROI from passive links, generated from high-quality content, was rapidly outpacing that of manual link building.  \r\n\r\n<img src=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/07\/roi-of-manual-vs-passive-link-building.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1400\" height=\"1255\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-29098\" \/>\r\n\r\nHowever, this isn\u2019t to say link building is necessarily the wrong strategy; it just depends. While we\u2019ve mostly shifted away from manual link building, we still recommend it in certain situations.\r\n\r\nStartups, for example, require manual link building at first while the brand is relatively unheard of. Clients in industries with high-link value also see significant ROI from manual outreach. \r\n\r\n<div class=\"video-container\"><iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/-_s3JrM-6hg\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen><\/iframe><\/div>\r\n\r\n<h2>Why Digital PR Matters<\/h2>\r\nDigital PR is important because of the compounding effects it has. When done well, digital PR will help you establish brand identity, enhance your reputation, and then generate more leads and customers \u2014 all while improving your DA. \r\n\r\nA successful digital PR campaign can result in making your brand a household name online, so the next time a journalist or blogger is looking to reference a study or post, they\u2019ll say, \u201cHey, I know that brand. Their stuff is the best. I\u2019ll link to them.\u201d \r\n\r\nTake <a href=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/work\/financial-seo-content-marketing\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Lexington Law<\/a>, for example, a credit repair client that came to us with a solid content strategy but sat in a very competitive vertical. \r\n\r\nSiege\u2019s content marketing and <a href=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/services\/link-building\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">digital PR services<\/a> boosted multiple pieces of content to the top of SERPS and generated a number of passive links.\r\n\r\nOur piece on <a href=\"https:\/\/www.lexingtonlaw.com\/blog\/credit-cards\/millennial-spending-habits.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Millenial Spending Habits<\/a>, for example, ranks on page one of search results and has generated hundreds of unique links over time. \r\n\r\nIn competitive industries like this, digital PR keeps you in the game. Having a solid digital PR strategy gives you a competitive advantage over competitors and sets you up for long-term success. \r\n\r\n<h2>Create a Successful Digital PR Strategy<\/h2>\r\nAlthough Siege has been able to land content in Fast Company, Thrillist, Business Insider, and more, it didn\u2019t come without some trial and error. \r\n\r\nCreating an effective digital PR strategy requires some legwork up front. You\u2019ll need to know exactly who you\u2019re trying to reach \u2014 both in terms of news outlets and your ultimate audience \u2014 and the  <a href=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/creation\/content-marketing-best-practicesl\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">content marketing best practices<\/a> necessary to rank highly. \r\n\r\n<img src=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/07\/7-steps-for-a-successful-digital-pr-campaign.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1400\" height=\"1317\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-29092\" \/>\r\n\r\n<h3>1. Define Your Goals<\/h3>\r\nKnowing what you want to accomplish is critical in, well, pretty much every strategy. However, with digital PR being a larger and more all-encompassing term, it\u2019s important to be very intentional in your goal-setting.\r\n\r\nIf you don\u2019t have a narrow focus, you\u2019ll find yourself casting too wide of a net and likely coming up empty. \r\n\r\nAt Siege, we like using <b>S.M.A.R.T. goals<\/b> (Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, Time-bound). For example, if improving your SEO was the goal of your digital PR strategy, a S.M.A.R.T. goal may look like this: \r\n\r\n<b>\u201cWe want to improve our DA from 43 to 50 by the end of Q2.\u201d<\/b>\r\n\r\n<h3>2. Identify Your Audience<\/h3> \r\nIdentifying your target audience early on is perhaps the most important part of this process, as it will be crucial for building your pitch list (more on this later).\r\n\r\nAudience research is one of the biggest separators of digital PR and link building. Good audience research will give you insight into what your target audience is actually talking about, not what has the highest search volume. As a result, you\u2019re likely to find low-difficulty terms that convert. \r\n\r\nWhen jumping into audience research, ask yourself: \r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>What\u2019s my audience interested in?<\/li>\r\n<li>How old are they? <\/li>\r\n<li>Where are they located?<\/li>\r\n<li>Where are they in their career<\/li>\r\n<li>What income bracket are they in?<\/li> \r\n<\/ul>\r\n\r\nAudience research tools like <a href=\"https:\/\/sparktoro.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Sparktoro<\/a> and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.brandwatch.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Brandwatch<\/a> can help you sort this information and expedite this step. \r\n\r\n<h3>3. Brainstorm Topics<\/h3>\r\nContent marketers have the difficult task of identifying a question within an industry and then creating a unique and engaging answer to it through content. At Siege, there are a few content marketing tips we\u2019ve integrated into our brainstorming process to ensure we\u2019re creating content that\u2019s optimized for digital PR. \r\n\r\nOur brainstorming process meshes a lot of different things: competitor analysis, SERP analysis, backlink analysis, and more. It\u2019s extensive, but well worth the time.  \r\n\r\nAhrefs, Google Analytics, SEM Rush, and Reddit are a few helpful tools we use for brainstorming topics.\r\n\r\nWe also enjoy the good ol\u2019 fashioned method of putting our heads together and bouncing ideas off each other. Check out our podcast below on exactly that. \r\n\r\n<iframe height=\"200px\" width=\"100%\" frameborder=\"no\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless src=\"https:\/\/player.simplecast.com\/a036cdeb-6924-4c51-aad5-616cd1f441d9?dark=false\"><\/iframe>\r\n\r\n[podcast-cta itunes=\"https:\/\/podcasts.apple.com\/us\/podcast\/content-and-conversation-seo-tips-from-siege-media\/id1289467174\" stitcher=\"https:\/\/www.stitcher.com\/show\/content-and-conversation-seo-tips-from-siege-media\" spotify=\"https:\/\/open.spotify.com\/show\/1kiaFGXO5UcT2qXVRuXjsM\"]\r\n\r\n<h3>4. Create an Outreach List<\/h3> \r\nFrom your audience research, you\u2019ll have an idea of the type of publications and media outlets you\u2019ll want to reach out to cover your piece. \r\n\r\nPut these publications into a list and trim it down to only the most relevant, remembering that digital PR prioritizes the relevancy and focus of the publication over the number of publications reached out to. \r\n\r\nGather the email addresses of the specific reporters you\u2019ll be contacting. When contacting large publications, dive into the stories they cover and make sure you\u2019re finding the journalist who is most likely to be interested in your content. \r\n\r\n<h3>5. Dazzle With Design<\/h3>\r\nWhen thinking about design, make sure you\u2019re not just adding images for the sake of having images. Ask yourself how you can use graphics and images to add value to the piece and enhance the point you\u2019re trying to make. \r\n\r\nAt Siege, we take <a href=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/services\/graphic-design\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">our design services<\/a> as seriously (if not more) as the copy. We use infographics as a way to display data in a more digestible way, like in the example from The Zebra below.\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/07\/importance-of-design.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1400\" height=\"1508\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-29097\" \/>\r\n\r\nConsider what function design can play in your post: \r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Will it make data more accessible to the reader?<\/li> \r\n<li>Can it highlight the main points of a large section of copy?<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n\r\nDesign is pivotal because it can flex your brand and surmise large blocks of the copy at the same time. \r\n\r\n<h3>6. Pitch Your Product<\/h3> \r\nPitching is an art when it comes to digital PR. \r\n\r\nJournalists receive tons of pitches every day, so standing out from the crowd requires a calculated approach. Make sure you\u2019re keeping your email short and to the point, but you\u2019re giving the journalist enough so they know what the content is about and why it matters.\r\n\r\nAt Siege, we like the AIDA method for pitches, which breaks down the email into four phases: <b>Attention, Interest, Desire, and Action<\/b>. \r\n\r\n<div class=\"video-container\"><iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/bvoxOtRq844\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen><\/iframe><\/div>\r\n\r\nBy using the AIDA method, the reader is naturally guided through the email until they arrive at the desired action. In practice, the method looks like this: \r\n\r\n<img src=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/07\/aida-method.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1400\" height=\"1018\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-29093\" \/>\r\n\r\n<h3>7. Measure the Results<\/h3>\r\nSo how exactly do you track \u201cbrand awareness\u201d?\r\n\r\nIt\u2019s hard to quantify if your brand is picking up steam, but there are a number of insightful metrics that gauge whether or not your content and brand are gaining popularity. \r\n\r\nA few of these include:\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Earned links<\/li>\r\n<li>Organic visibility<\/li>\r\n<li>Brand searches<\/li>\r\n<li>Number of leads<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n\r\nWhile these are a few big ones to be aware of, the list is expansive and can include any SEO metrics you currently track. \r\n\r\nAs you see success in your digital PR campaign over time, you can expect corresponding SEO wins. \r\n\r\n<a href=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/marketing\/digital-pr-cost\"><img src=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/07\/cost-of-digital-pr-cta-1.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1401\" height=\"518\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-29099\" \/><\/a>\r\n\r\n<h2>Successful Digital PR in Action<\/h2>\r\nAfter a decade of existence, we\u2019ve experimented with pretty much every type of content. While all types of content work in some capacity, some better lend themselves to <a href=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/marketing\/digital-pr-examples\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">digital PR campaigns<\/a> and building a brand.\r\n\r\nHere are a few:\r\n\r\n<h3>Data-Driven Campaigns<\/h3> \r\nData-driven campaigns like surveys and existing data studies are a great and repeatable model for providing valuable information to publications. When coupled with a unique visualization style, data-driven content can be gold for journalists who work in a specific niche. \r\n\r\nTake <a href=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/work\/possible-content-marketing\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Possible Finance<\/a>, for instance, an alternative personal loan solution striving for financial fairness for all. \r\n\r\nThis client had seen success through traditional PR but was looking to enhance its digital presence and build a strong library of backlinks. \r\n\r\nIn order to help, we ran a survey about giving up a personal expense to splurge on pets. The data, supported by stellar design, earned <a href=\"https:\/\/www.possiblefinance.com\/blog\/covid-pet-spend\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">the post<\/a> over 40 backlinks.\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/07\/data-driven-campaign-example-1.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1400\" height=\"1021\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-29094\" \/>\r\n\r\nAnother method we\u2019ve seen success with at Siege is existing data campaigns. This is a nice blend of the creative and analytical, as we take <a href=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/creation\/data-sources\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">data that\u2019s available to the public<\/a> and use it to craft a unique story. \r\n\r\nThis worked especially well for our friends at The Zebra when we created a study illustrating that <a href=\"https:\/\/www.thezebra.com\/resources\/home\/median-home-size-in-us\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Americans were living in bigger homes with fewer people<\/a>. Using public data from the U.S Census Bureau and Zillow, we were able to easily pull data together and create a compelling story.\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/07\/data-driven-campaign-example-2.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1400\" height=\"773\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-29095\" \/>\r\n\r\n<h3>Creative Campaigns<\/h3> \r\nData or no data, unique visualization can set you apart from similar content and instantly contend you as a candidate for reference by major publications. \r\n\r\nAnimations, for instance,  are a great medium for step-by-step content. In our example from <a href=\"https:\/\/www.berries.com\/blog\/cut-fruits-and-veggies\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Shari's Berries<\/a>, we\u2019re able to show what seeding a pomegranate looks like alongside directions for how to do it.

We do.\r\n\r\nThe great fictional chef Auguste Gusteau from \u201cRatatouille\u201d once said, \u201cAnyone can cook,\u201d and we feel a similar way about content.\r\n\r\nAnyone can create great content, but not everyone has the recipe for replicating content success.\r\n\r\nAs a 120-person content marketing agency that\u2019s driven <a href=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/about\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">$87 million in traffic value<\/a> for clients, we\u2019d like to share our secret ingredients for generating best-in-class content that produces measurable results.\r\n\r\nCheck out this essential marketer\u2019s guide to learn about what content creation is, why it\u2019s important, and how to do it.

Below, we share our recipe for content success by walking through the steps of our content creation process. In just 10 steps, you\u2019ll learn how to make effective content and measure its success.\r\n\r\n<img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-29049\" src=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/07\/the-10-step-content-creation-process.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1400\" height=\"1358\" \/>\r\n<h3>1. Set Goals for Your Content<\/h3>\r\nYour first step in the content creation process is to determine what goals you want your content to achieve. Whether you need to <a href=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/strategy\/increase-website-traffic\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">increase organic traffic<\/a> to your site or improve your domain authority, use your marketing goals to inform your process and strategy.\r\n\r\nRemember to define clear goals that are SMART (specific, measurable, attainable, relevant, and time-bound). Find a couple examples of SMART content goals below:\r\n<ul>\r\n \t<li>\u201cIn six months, the content team will increase traffic to \/blog by 20%.\u201d<\/li>\r\n \t<li>\u201cBy next quarter, we will increase links to the blog by 15%.\u201d<\/li>\r\n \t<li>\u201cBy 2023, we will improve our site\u2019s domain rating by 1-2 points.\u201d&lt;\/li &gt;<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n<h3>2. Develop a Content Strategy<\/h3>\r\nOnce you have clear goals, use them as a guideline to put together your content strategy. Your <a href=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/seo\/content-strategy\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">content strategy<\/a> combines SEO and content marketing to identify the types of content that will bring the most value to your business.\r\n\r\nTo create an effective content strategy, you\u2019ll need to consider the following:\r\n<ul>\r\n \t<li><b>Your brand:<\/b> Consider your company mission, brand voice, value propositions, and target audience when developing your content strategy.<\/li>\r\n \t<li><b>Your competitors:<\/b> Look at what content is working well for your competitors (i.e., what topics they rank for) and improve on that strategy.<\/li>\r\n \t<li><b>Your market:<\/b> Identify how much growth is possible and what topic ideas are the most relevant in your market.<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n<h3>3. Perform Keyword Research<\/h3>\r\nNow that you have an idea of your content strategy, the next step is to dig into keyword research. Keyword research helps you understand how your target audience is searching for information that\u2019s relevant to your brand, products, or services.\r\n\r\nAn efficient way to strategize keyword research is with a keyword opposition to benefit (KOB) analysis. KOB analysis involves gathering data on hundreds of topics in your vertical and using that data to identify and prioritize the topics you can quickly rank for at every stage of the buyer\u2019s journey.\r\n\r\nWhen you create content around topics identified in a KOB analysis, the following can happen:\r\n<ul>\r\n \t<li>Your site ranks for more relevant topics over time<\/li>\r\n \t<li>Your domain authority increases<\/li>\r\n \t<li>You achieve a sizable ROI<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\nUse our <a href=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/05\/KOB-Keyword-Research.xlsx\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">downloadable KOB analysis spreadsheet<\/a> and watch the video below on our process to get started.\r\n\r\n<div class=\"video-container\"><iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/bZe771lsU6c\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen><\/iframe><\/div>\r\n\r\n<h3>4. Choose the Right Content Format<\/h3>\r\nAfter researching the keywords you\u2019ll target, you\u2019ll need to decide what <a href=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/creation\/types-of-content-marketing\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">content format is the best fit<\/a> for relaying that information to relevant audiences. Keep in mind how your target audience prefers to consume content as well.\r\n\r\nA pro tip is to take inspiration from what is already ranking on the SERPs.\r\n\r\nLet\u2019s use the query \u201cwhat is content marketing\u201d as an example. The ranking search results for this topic are mainly informational blog posts and guides about content marketing, so this tells you that your content should probably take on this form.\r\n\r\n<img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-29050\" src=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/07\/choose-the-right-content-format.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1400\" height=\"982\" \/>\r\n\r\nEvery SERP is different, though, and it\u2019s important to check them out before choosing a format. It\u2019d be a shame to put valuable time and energy into a detailed long-form guide when all the top ranking results are videos.\r\n\r\nUltimately, picking the right format helps you stay competitive on the SERP.\r\n<h3>5. Create SEO-optimized Content<\/h3>\r\nWith the right format in mind, it\u2019s time to start creating. In content marketing, the goal is to create <a href=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/creation\/seo-friendly-content\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">SEO-friendly content<\/a> or content that satisfies both the user and Google.\r\n\r\nAs you start writing, prioritize answering the user\u2019s search intent as quickly as possible, while also optimizing the post structure to signal the information\u2019s value to Google.\r\n\r\nWhether it\u2019s a definition of a term or a step-by-step breakdown of a complex process, try to distill the information down into key takeaways that are easily scannable.\r\n\r\nBelow are some more tips for making SEO-friendly content:\r\n<ul>\r\n \t<li><b>Use a simple <a href=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/seo\/post-structure-for-seo\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">post structure<\/a><\/b> that relies on an H1, H2s, and H3s to create hierarchy in a post.<\/li>\r\n \t<li><b>Optimize your title<\/b> and <a href=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/seo\/title-tags\">title tag<\/a> for better CTR.<\/li>\r\n \t<li><b>Include a meta description<\/b> that is 120-156 characters long and includes your target keyword and a call to action.<\/li>\r\n \t<li><b>Keep copy digestible<\/b> with short paragraphs and concise sentences.<\/li>\r\n \t<li><b>Improve scannability<\/b> by using bullet points or crawlable tables to summarize information.<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n<h3>6. Edit Your Content<\/h3>\r\nEditing is an important step in the content creation process. In addition to catching typos or correcting grammar, copy editors make sure that your content aligns with your brand\u2019s voice, tone, and preferred editorial style.\r\n\r\nIt\u2019s essential that your content is representative of your brand because it functions as a direct line of communication from business to reader. If your copy is full of mistakes or doesn\u2019t sound right, readers may be put off and stop engaging with your content.\r\n\r\nAlways take the time to edit your content before you publish it so that you can put your brand\u2019s best foot forward. In the end, consistent brand messaging helps your business build trust with your audience and sets you apart from competitors.\r\n<h3>7. Upload and Publish Your Content<\/h3>\r\nOnce your content is ready, the next step is to get it online where people can see it. You\u2019ll do this by uploading it to your content management system (CMS), which is a software that hosts digital content in one place and helps you display it on the web.\r\n\r\nUploading and publishing your content is a relatively straightforward process, but there's one more thing you should do to make sure your content has the best chance of ranking and that's building your internal link structure.\r\n\r\nIt\u2019s important to build your <a href=\"https:\/\/support.google.com\/webmasters\/answer\/7451184?hl=en\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">internal link structure<\/a> by linking to similar content after you publish. The following graphic details some essential do\u2019s and don\u2019ts when it comes to internal linking.\r\n\r\n<img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-29051\" src=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/07\/upload-and-publish-your-content.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1401\" height=\"901\" \/>\r\n<h3>8. Promote To Relevant Audiences<\/h3>\r\nPromoting your content helps nudge others to view or share what you created. Social media and email marketing are a couple of ways to promote content to your target audience, but one strategy that we\u2019re experts at is <a href=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/services\/link-building\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">link building<\/a>.\r\n\r\nAs a promotion strategy, link building helps your content rank more quickly and boosts your traffic and views. At Siege, we have experience generating over 5,000 links per month for our clients and have the process almost down to a science.\r\n\r\nTry out the following effective <a href=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/marketing\/link-building-strategies\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">link building strategies<\/a> to promote your content:\r\n<ul>\r\n \t<li><b>Broken link building:<\/b> This is the process of finding broken links on resource pages and reaching out to the site to suggest your content as an alternative.<\/li>\r\n \t<li><b>Link reclamation:<\/b> This involves reclaiming your lost or unlinked organic mentions by reaching out to websites and asking them to properly credit your site.<\/li>\r\n \t<li><b>Infographics\/shareables:<\/b> This strategy pitches a shareable asset, like an infographic or printable, along with an article as a value add to encourage sites to share.<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n<h3>9. Analyze Your Content\u2019s Performance<\/h3>\r\nNow that your content is created and (hopefully) being indexed by Google, it\u2019s time to measure its performance. Using tools like Google Analytics or Search Console, you can analyze content performance to see if your strategy is working or if it needs a little help.\r\n\r\nDepending on your goals, track the following performance metrics to measure your success and find areas for improvement.\r\n<ul>\r\n \t<li><b>Organic traffic:<\/b> This is the amount of unpaid traffic coming to your site from search engines. The majority of organic traffic is driven by content that ranks high on Google.<\/li>\r\n \t<li><b>Pageviews:<\/b> This is the number of people who\u2019ve viewed your content. Typically, there will be a number of views listed and a number for the amount of unique users that visited.<\/li>\r\n \t<li><b>Bounce rate:<\/b> This is the percentage of users who leave, or \u201cbounce,\u201d from your site after only viewing one page. This metric offers insight into whether your content satisfied the user\u2019s search intent or not.<\/li>\r\n \t<li><b>Conversion rate:<\/b> This is the percentage of users who interact with a CTA and perform the desired action (e.g., a user fills out an email form to sign up for a newsletter).<\/li>\r\n \t<li><b>Time on page:<\/b> This is the amount of time a user spends on a particular page and can tell you if users are staying long enough to read your content.<\/li>\r\n \t<li><b>Audience growth:<\/b> This is the number of new leads or subscribers earned from your content.<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n<h3>10. Update Content Annually<\/h3>\r\nThe final step in our content process is to revisit your content and update it regularly. We\u2019ve recently found that after making updates to posts on our own blog, our site\u2019s organic traffic experienced a 52% lift.\r\n\r\n<img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-29053\" src=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/07\/update-content-annually.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1401\" height=\"901\" \/>\r\n\r\nYou can replicate this growth for your business by updating your content at least once a year. If your content belongs to a niche industry or is on a highly competitive SERP, it\u2019s beneficial to update it more frequently.\r\n\r\nUpdating your content improves its <a href=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/seo\/freshness-distance\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">freshness distance<\/a>, or the distance between the oldest post and most recent post on the SERP. A better freshness distance helps your content outrank older results on the SERP, and it gives your content a competitive timestamp that helps boost a piece\u2019s CTR.\r\n\r\nNot all content should be treated equally, though. Find some helpful signs for when to update or not update content below.\r\n\r\n<b>Signs to update content:<\/b>\r\n<ul>\r\n \t<li>The <b>content is still relevant<\/b> to your business<\/li>\r\n \t<li>The content is <b>over a year old<\/b><\/li>\r\n \t<li>The content\u2019s SERP has <b>competitive timestamps<\/b><\/li>\r\n \t<li>The content is <b>ranking at the bottom of page one<\/b> or the <b>top of page two<\/b> on the SERP<\/li>\r\n \t<li>The <b>search intent<\/b> of the SERP <b>has changed<\/b><\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n<b>Signs to leave content as is:<\/b>\r\n<ul>\r\n \t<li>The content is a <b>survey or study<\/b> that <b>isn\u2019t tied to search volume<\/b><\/li>\r\n \t<li>The content <b>isn\u2019t ranking<\/b> or isn\u2019t ranking well<\/li>\r\n \t<li>The content was <b>published recently<\/b><\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\nUse this 10-step content creation process as a road map for creating killer content every time.

Infographics are featured across the web as a supplement to a blog post or as a standalone piece of content. This content format is effective because it visually explains a topic or <a href=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/creation\/blog-post-images\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">creates a narrative through images<\/a>.\r\n\r\nOne of the major reasons <a href=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/creation\/why-and-how-infographics-work\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">infographics<\/a> are beneficial is because they are an excellent link building tool.

As a content format, it\u2019s incredibly useful for explaining concepts or products, demonstrating thought leadership, or just providing entertainment.\r\n\r\nWith many SERPs becoming dominated by video, if you\u2019re not creating this type of content, your business will get left in the dust.

    "title": "Link Building Prospecting Scorecard [Free Outreach Prospecting Tool]",
    "content": "At Siege, we\u2019ve collectively sent over <i>1 million<\/i> outreach emails and evaluated several millions more prospects along the way.\r\n\r\nIt\u2019s safe to say that we\u2019ve learned a lot about the patterns and signals, both positive and negative, that indicate whether to pitch or skip a given site.\r\n\r\nIn this post, we divulge a few of the elements our team looks for when prospecting for backlinks \u2014 and our <a href=\"https:\/\/chrome.google.com\/webstore\/detail\/prospecting-scorecard\/daekhcmbnjlmlgejaipalcaidkbnofei\">free prospecting scorecard<\/a> Chrome extension that was previously reserved for internal use \u2014 so you can quickly assess whether a given site is worth pitching in your outreach efforts.\r\n\r\n<img class=\"alignnone wp-image-28952 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/07\/scorecard-example.png\" alt=\"Siege Media link building prospecting scorecard example\" width=\"1401\" height=\"893\" \/>\r\n<blockquote class=\"definition\">\r\n<p align=\"center\"><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/chrome.google.com\/webstore\/detail\/prospecting-scorecard\/daekhcmbnjlmlgejaipalcaidkbnofei\" rel=\"noopener\">Get the Scorecard Chrome Extension \u2192<\/a><\/p>\r\n<\/blockquote>\r\n<h2>Positive Signals in Link Building<\/h2>\r\nWe\u2019ll start with some of the things we look for that indicate whether a site is worth pitching our content. At a high level, we want to make sure the prospect is actively publishing and updating their site, would be willing to link to us, and has a clear way to contact them.\r\n<h3>Find a Recent Timestamp<\/h3>\r\nIs the site actively being maintained and publishing new content? One way to answer this is to look at the timestamp on the post. If the current year isn\u2019t present anywhere on the page, it\u2019s probably a good indication that the site is no longer active.\r\n\r\nAlthough the year is not always a perfect metric (because an automated annual update to the copyright in the footer could trigger a positive signal), it\u2019s still a worthy analysis, and one of the metrics highlighted on our prospecting scorecard.\r\n\r\nIf you do land on an outdated post, a more manual approach to evaluate recency is to navigate to the blog home and see if any posts have been published more recently.\r\n<h3>Evaluate External Links<\/h3>\r\nDoes the prospect consistently cite external resources? If you find outbound links to external resources, you know the site isn\u2019t fundamentally opposed to linking out \u2014 so pitching your content isn\u2019t out of the question.\r\n\r\nThere are some other considerations regarding the types of outbound links and how to assess whether your site will be acceptable to the prospect. More on this later.\r\n\r\nYou can also check for broken links and add value in your pitch by helpfully pointing out the issue and suggesting your content as a natural replacement \u2014 this is known as <a href=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/marketing\/link-building-strategies\">broken link building<\/a>.\r\n\r\nOur tool surfaces the ratio of external to internal links as a good baseline metric for assessing whether the site would be open to sending a link your way.\r\n\r\n<img class=\"alignnone wp-image-28953 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/07\/scorecard-internal-to-external-links.png\" alt=\"Siege Media outreach prospecting scorecard highlighting external links to internal links ratio\" width=\"1400\" height=\"1646\" \/>\r\n<h3>Identify Contact Information<\/h3>\r\nIs there an email address, contact form, or about us page that contains an email address? These are all good starting points for identifying whether or not an outreach email will even reach the prospect.\r\n\r\nIt\u2019s always best to send a personalized email to the prospect\u2019s direct address, as opposed to a general company email or form, but success can be had in all contact methods. If our tool identifies a hyperlinked mailto email address, it will call it to your attention with a black border:\r\n\r\n<img class=\"alignnone wp-image-28954 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/07\/scorecard-email.png\" alt=\"Tool to find a persons email address during outreach for link building.\" width=\"1401\" height=\"835\" \/>\r\n\r\nWhile there are overall quality signals of a site that are obvious to the naked eye, they\u2019re more difficult to quantify into an algorithm, which is why this list of positive signals is far from exhaustive.\r\n\r\nLet\u2019s shift gears and look for some of the things that might disqualify a site as a good outreach prospect.\r\n<h2>Negative Signals for Link-Building Prospects<\/h2>\r\nIf we had a nickel for every outreach email that ended in rejection or failure, this article would likely be about philanthropy (because we\u2019d be millionaires many times over).\r\n\r\nThe obvious question is: What led us to incorrectly believe the site would be receptive to our pitch, and more importantly, what could have alerted us to skip the prospect and move on to greener pastures?\r\n<h3>Exclusively Authorized Domain Extensions<\/h3>\r\nAbove, we discussed the positive signals of external links on the prospect\u2019s site, but not all external links are comparable. If a prospect exclusively links out to authorized domains like .gov or .edu, the probability that they would make an exception for your commercial domain is low.\r\n\r\n<img class=\"alignnone wp-image-28955 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/07\/scorecard-external-link-domains.png\" alt=\"Siege Media's prospecting scorecard highlighting external links to authorized domain extensions.\" width=\"1401\" height=\"760\" \/>\r\n\r\nIf you find a page with nearly 100% of external links pointing toward sites with credible top-level domains, it\u2019s worth navigating to other pages to see if this is a general principle of the publisher or an isolated instance.\r\n\r\nIn other words, don\u2019t let this one metric discourage you from a potential pitch, but mentally log it as a negative signal (or let our scorecard log it for you).\r\n\r\nOur tool will analyze the external links and metrics on the page you open the extension, but will not crawl the entire site to get a comprehensive view of the prospect\u2019s citation policy.\r\n<h3>Nofollow and Sponsored Outbound Links<\/h3>\r\nDoes the prospect mark their external links as nofollow or do they only include sponsored links in their posts? If so, this is a negative signal if you\u2019re like us and rely on content quality to incentivize a link instead of paying for placements.\r\n\r\n<img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-28978\" src=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/07\/scorecard-sponsored-links.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1401\" height=\"592\" \/>\r\n\r\nOur Chrome extension will call these links to your attention with a red border and text box identifying the link\u2019s associated rel tag (i.e., sponsored, nofollow, etc.).\r\n<h3>Solely Sponsored Posts and Advertising<\/h3>\r\nAs we mentioned earlier, we don\u2019t pay for link placements, so it\u2019s a helpful insight if we can identify sites that are likely to ask for money in exchange for a backlink.\r\n\r\nSome of the most common words that indicate a site will charge for link insertions are:\r\n<ul>\r\n \t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\">Advertise<\/li>\r\n \t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\">Advertising<\/li>\r\n \t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\">Affiliate Disclosure<\/li>\r\n \t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\">Work With Me<\/li>\r\n \t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\">Work With Us<\/li>\r\n \t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\">Sponsored Post<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\nOur scorecard will highlight these words in red.\r\n\r\nTaking a quick detour back to the positive signals, there are also some words that indicate intent to collaborate, such as:\r\n<ul>\r\n \t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\">Submit a Tip<\/li>\r\n \t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\">Write for Us<\/li>\r\n \t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\">Pitches<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\nThese positive words will be highlighted green:\r\n\r\n<img class=\"alignnone wp-image-28957 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/07\/scorecard-positive-words.png\" alt=\"Prospecting scorecard highlighting positive keywords and email addresses in body copy on sites.\" width=\"1401\" height=\"893\" \/>\r\n<h2>Link-Qualified Leads<\/h2>\r\nIf you\u2019re a content marketer, PR specialist, or outreach specialist or are otherwise sending outreach emails for the purposes of link-building, LQLs are your version of a sales qualified lead.\r\n\r\nOutreach is hard, and it\u2019s worth noting that our scorecard is not a perfect solution. Even if our scorecard greenlights a pitch, there are a number of factors that could cause a prospect to ignore or outright reject your pitch.\r\n\r\nThis is why we\u2019ve made a major strategic shift in our <a href=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/marketing\/manual-link-building\">link-building philosophy<\/a> to focus on driving organic search traffic with high intent to build a link.\r\n\r\nThis shift towards <a href=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/seo\/what-is-link-building\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">less manual link building<\/a> is one reason we are open-sourcing our tool for you to quickly qualify your outreach prospects.\r\n\r\nGood luck out there.\r\n<blockquote class=\"definition\">\r\n<p align=\"center\"><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/chrome.google.com\/webstore\/detail\/prospecting-scorecard\/daekhcmbnjlmlgejaipalcaidkbnofei\" rel=\"noopener\">Get the Scorecard Chrome Extension \u2192<\/a><\/p>\r\n<\/blockquote>"

    "content": "Mathematically speaking, it\u2019s possible to get infinitely closer to something and never reach it. The same can be said of perfect SEO.\r\n\r\nThe concept above is called an asymptote: a line extending toward a curve forever without intersecting. You probably see where this is going.\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/07\/the-seo-asymptote-page-1.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1400\" height=\"860\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-28976\" \/>\r\n\r\nSince Google ranks search results with an ever-changing, proprietary algorithm, mastering the platform we use to connect with an audience is both essential and, yes, <i>asymptotic<\/i>. \r\n\r\nThat\u2019s why only the best writers, brands, and agencies can rank content consistently.\r\n\r\nBut if it\u2019s so difficult, why bother trying? First, because optimized content connects users to better information more efficiently. Second, because it leads to real, quantifiable value for a brand \u2014 just ask our clients, who have seen over <a href=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/work\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">$86 million generated in traffic value per year<\/a>.\r\n\r\nSo, let\u2019s dig into how, when done well, <a href=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/creation\/seo-content\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">SEO content creation<\/a> provides as much value for the end user as it does the brand.\r\n\r\n<h2>What Is SEO Writing?<\/h2>\r\n\r\n<blockquote class=\"definition\">\r\n    <p><strong>SEO writing<\/strong> is a strategy for increasing website visibility and traffic by aligning a webpage's copy, structure, and metadata with a search engine\u2019s ranking algorithms.<\/p>\r\n<\/blockquote>\r\n\r\nAt its most basic level, SEO writing allows us to position our content in such a way that it\u2019s more likely to:\r\n<ul>\r\n     <li>Show up in a user\u2019s search engine results page (SERP)<\/li>\r\n     <li>Get clicked on<\/li>\r\n     <li>(Most importantly) deliver what they\u2019re looking for<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\nSEO writing isn\u2019t only a marketing tactic \u2014 it\u2019s an essential means of delivering information to living, breathing, curious people who may or may not be looking to purchase something right now.\r\n\r\nIn practice, this type of writing revolves around potential site visitors\u2019 search queries \u2014 the words and phrases they type into a search bar. Search query data tells us three things about users:\r\n<ol>\r\n     <li>What they want to know (via their queries)<\/li>\r\n     <li>What they value (via which links they click on)<\/li>\r\n     <li>Why they click on what they click on (via commonalities between the top results for a given query)<\/li>\r\n<\/ol>\r\n<img src=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/07\/benefits-of-search-optimized-content.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1400\" height=\"660\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-28928\" \/>\r\n\r\n<h2>Why SEO Content Writing Matters<\/h2>\r\n\r\nEven if perfect SEO content is something of a moving target, it\u2019s still possible (and worthwhile) to do it effectively enough to rank consistently. \r\n\r\nOptimized website content writing matters because it helps align content with the expectations of the reader, which increases the likelihood that it will rise to the top of the SERP \u2014 specifically, Google\u2019s.\r\n\r\n<b><a href=\"https:\/\/gs.statcounter.com\/search-engine-market-share\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Nearly 92%<\/a> of total web searches are performed on Google.<\/b> That means reaching an audience means optimizing for Google. And since reaching an audience means reaching customers, better SEO writing means more potential revenue.\r\n\r\nIn a perfect world, the best posts featuring the most thoughtful and objective research and writing would always pop up at the top of the results. Since this isn\u2019t a perfect world, search algorithms have to calculate what makes one post better (i.e., a better match for a query) than another. \r\n\r\nSo, want to <a href=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/strategy\/increase-website-traffic\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">grow your organic traffic<\/a> using SEO content (as we did for <a href=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/work\/norton-content-marketing\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Norton<\/a>)? Want to genuinely <a href=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/creation\/content-creation\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">create better, more useful content<\/a> that users can get real value from (as all content publishers should strive to do)?\r\n\r\nUnderstanding SEO best practices and applying them thoughtfully will help you do both.\r\n\r\n<h2>9 SEO Content Writing Tips<\/h2>\r\n\r\nGoogle has hundreds of ranking factors \u2014 and none of us really knows for sure what they are or how they\u2019re weighted. \r\n\r\nHowever, there are a handful of tested ways we as SEO content writers optimize our clients\u2019 content in such a way that Google is more likely to elevate it for targeted search queries. \r\n\r\nHere\u2019s how to write SEO content that stands a chance of ranking.\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/07\/seo-writing-tips-to-improve-serp-ranking.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1400\" height=\"1400\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-28936\" \/>\r\n\r\n<h3>1. Know Your Audience <\/h3>\r\n\r\nSEO writing starts before you type the first word. As we\u2019ve outlined previously in our <a href=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/marketing\/content-marketing-tips\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">19 content marketing tips<\/a>, before you write a piece, you need to be sure you have a strong understanding of who will be reading it. Be sure you know:\r\n<ul>\r\n     <li>Who your audience is (and <a href=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/marketing\/diversity-equity-inclusion\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">what matters to them<\/a>)<\/li>\r\n     <li>What kind of content they would expect your brand to be an authority on<\/li>\r\n     <li>What specific terms, questions, or other queries they search for in relation to that content field<\/li>\r\n     <li>What competing websites they\u2019re visiting to access that content<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\nRemember, great content starts with a sound <a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=Yt2oWI1cVS0\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">content strategy<\/a>.\r\n\r\n<h4>How to Learn More About Your (Client\u2019s) Audience<\/h4>\r\n\r\nWhether you\u2019re writing for your own brand or on behalf of a client, here are some vital sources for learning about the brand\u2019s ideal audience:\r\n<ul>\r\n     <li>Any <a href=\"https:\/\/blog.hubspot.com\/marketing\/buyer-persona-definition-under-100-sr\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">buyer persona<\/a> documentation<\/li>\r\n     <li>Copies of sales calls or demos<\/li>\r\n     <li>Common questions from customers in the sales process<\/li>\r\n     <li>Any existing branded FAQs<\/li>\r\n     <li>New team member onboarding documentation and\/or meetings<\/li>\r\n     <li>Email form submissions<\/li>\r\n     <li><a href=\"http:\/\/Sparktoro.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Sparktoro.com<\/a>, which allows you to quickly find relevant blogs, podcasts, and influencers<\/li>\r\n     <li>Keyword frameworks that tie to pages likely to generate sales<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n<h3>2. Apply Long-Tail Keyword Research to Audience Research<\/h3>\r\n\r\nSearch data is the core of this research \u2014 every piece of content you write should be based on known queries your target market is searching for. Don\u2019t just guess at what might appeal to that audience. Instead, cater each piece of content you create to a unique, specific keyword. \r\n\r\nFor example, let\u2019s say you\u2019re writing <a href=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/creation\/seo-friendly-content\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">SEO-friendly content<\/a> for a client that sells sustainable lifestyle products. \r\n\r\nRather than targeting short, general phrases like \u201cgreen living\u201d (short-tail keywords), aim for longer, more specific queries (long-tail keywords) that suggest the user is looking for more information, not just products.\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/07\/short-tail-vs-long-tail-keywords.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1400\" height=\"1060\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-28937\" \/>\r\n\r\nWhile this piece wouldn\u2019t necessarily be about a product someone could buy from the website publishing it, <b>it aligns with the values and interests<\/b> of people who would buy products from that site.\r\n\r\nAnd while the long-tail keyword has a much lower volume of searches, it also has much less competition and should be easier to rank for. (We use these figures to create a numerical score for keyword ideas, called a KOB analysis.)\r\n\r\n<a href=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/05\/KOB-Keyword-Research.xlsx\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-27689\" src=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/11\/02-download-our-kob-cta.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1400\" height=\"550\" \/><\/a>\r\n\r\nSpecifically, we use <a href=\"https:\/\/ahrefs.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Ahrefs<\/a> to source most of our keyword research, but you could also use free tools like:\r\n<ul>\r\n     <li><a href=\"https:\/\/ads.google.com\/nav\/selectaccount?authuser=0&dst=\/aw\/keywordplanner\/home&pli=1\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Google Keyword Planner<\/a>: Free, Ahrefs-like product from Google<\/li>\r\n     <li><a href=\"https:\/\/trends.google.com\/trends\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Google Trends<\/a>: Google tool for tracking search queries over time<\/li>\r\n     <li><a href=\"https:\/\/kparser.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Kparser<\/a>: Generates keyword ideas (with paid upgrades)<\/li>\r\n     <li><a href=\"https:\/\/answerthepublic.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">AnswerThePublic<\/a>: Creates visualizations for real search questions and autocomplete suggestions<\/li>\r\n     <li><a href=\"https:\/\/www.infinitesuggest.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Infinite Suggest<\/a>: Suggests relevant keywords based on simple phrases and topics<\/li>\r\n     <li><a href=\"https:\/\/questiondb.io\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">QuestionDB<\/a>: Helps generate keywords and topic ideas by showing questions users ask in relation to a given topic or keyword<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n<h3>3. Start at the Start<\/h3>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"video-container\"><iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/IgIzR2Z21nI\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen><\/iframe><\/div>\r\n\r\nOnce people get to your page, they need to know they\u2019re in the right place with a thoughtful, concise <a href=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/creation\/blog-introductions\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">blog introduction<\/a>.

Whether it\u2019s setting a narrative scene, giving a shocking fact, or posing an evocative question, <b>the first few sentences should turn a visitor into a reader<\/b> and keep them interested. \r\n\r\nHere\u2019s an example from <a href=\"https:\/\/www.thezebra.com\/homeowners-insurance\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">The Zebra<\/a>.\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/07\/grab-attention.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1400\" height=\"1250\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-28930\" \/>\r\n\r\n<h4>Preview<\/h4>\r\n\r\nWhen a visitor comes to your page, they will immediately want to know that they can find what they\u2019re looking for. Help them out with a quick summary, an explanation of the structure, and ideally visual elements like a table of contents or clear and organized subheadings.\r\n\r\n<h4>Proof<\/h4>\r\n\r\nIf your brand isn\u2019t ubiquitously known, they\u2019ll also need to know why you\u2019re qualified to provide this information. Links to case studies, author bylines or bios, peer review notices, and big-name affiliates or clients \u2014 not to mention attractive page design \u2014 can help you do this.\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/07\/offer-proof.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1400\" height=\"660\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-28932\" \/>\r\n\r\n<h4>Benefit<\/h4>\r\nWhat\u2019s in it for the reader? Chances are, they can get the same (or similar) information from countless other websites. Keep them on your page by telling them what makes your content the freshest, deepest, most complete, most trustworthy, or most valuable.\r\n\r\n<h3>4. Use Keywords Wisely<\/h3>\r\n\r\nMost of us know by now that keyword stuffing hurts both user experience and site rankings, but it\u2019s not always as simple as using the same phrase 10 times in one paragraph.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"https:\/\/developers.google.com\/search\/docs\/advanced\/guidelines\/irrelevant-keywords\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Google<\/a> defines stuffing (in part) as using search phrases out of context or \u201cnot as natural prose.\u201d You\u2019re writing for humans, not algorithms \u2014 the algorithms just help get your content in front of the right humans.\r\n\r\nLong-tail search queries are tools, not tricks. When utilized thoughtfully as user queries with demonstrated search volume, they lay a solid foundation for content for three reasons.\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/07\/value-of-long-tail-search-queries.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1400\" height=\"730\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-28940\" \/>\r\n\r\nRather than thinking of keywords as shortcuts to getting your page found, think of them as signposts that help search engines know they can direct certain types of traffic toward your page. \r\n\r\nWe recommend planting these signposts in each of these parts of your page:\r\n<ul>\r\n     <li><a href=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/seo\/how-to-create-the-best-url-structures\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">URL structure<\/a><\/li>\r\n     <li>Image alt text (at least once)<\/li>\r\n     <li>Meta description<\/li>\r\n     <li><a href=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/seo\/title-tags\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Title tag<\/a><\/li>\r\n     <li>H1<\/li>\r\n     <li>Intro<\/li>\r\n     <li>H2s (at least one)<\/li>\r\n     <li>Outro<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\nAs you can see, fundamental keyword best practices already lend your keyword(s) a pretty heavy presence. It\u2019s the opposite of Thanksgiving dinner \u2014 no stuffing required.\r\n\r\n<h3>Be Better<\/h3>\r\n\r\nAlways ensure that your content adds something better, more informative, more entertaining, or more useful to the conversation.\r\n\r\nWhen we write SEO content, we have an intention to rank \u2014 but we also have a responsibility to readers. Being better than your competitors is great for helping your content outrank theirs, but it also reflects more fundamental questions.\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/07\/provide-better-content.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1400\" height=\"600\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-28934\" \/>\r\n\r\nIf you don\u2019t have a good answer for the above questions, you may want to reconsider your SEO and content marketing strategies before moving forward. A good litmus test is checking the top results on the SERP and seeing if those pages are doing things you think you can do better in terms of the five factors below.\r\n\r\n<h4>Write Better Copy<\/h4>\r\n\r\nCould the given topic use a more personable voice \u2014 or a more authoritative one? Can you produce something more readable, easier to follow, more entertaining, or better researched?\r\n\r\n<h4>Give Better Information<\/h4>\r\n\r\nAre the current top pages giving outdated, incomplete, or even misleading information? Fill in the gaps.\r\n\r\n<h4>Present Better Design \/ User Experience<\/h4>\r\n\r\n<a href=\"https:\/\/www.npr.org\/sections\/thesalt\/2014\/12\/31\/370397449\/food-psychology-how-to-trick-your-palate-into-a-tastier-meal\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Studies show<\/a> that we perceive foods as tasting better when they\u2019re presented more attractively. It\u2019s much the same with content. You can make the same information more digestible just by presenting it in a better-looking, more intentional format.\r\n\r\n<h4>Scope Better<\/h4>\r\n\r\nCan you produce an even more comprehensive \u201ccomprehensive\u201d list, or home in on the best of the best options? \r\n\r\nGive users more of what they\u2019re looking for or less of what they\u2019re not by publishing content that either expands on existing knowledge or cuts through the chatter for complex topics.\r\n\r\n<h4>Have Better E-A-T<\/h4>\r\n\r\nStanding for Expertise, Authority, and Trustworthiness, <a href=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/seo\/what-is-eat\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">E-A-T<\/a> isn\u2019t actually a Google ranking factor, per se, because it isn\u2019t easily quantifiable. \r\n\r\nBut during <a href=\"https:\/\/youtu.be\/kvYb2bdtT7A?t=671\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">a roundtable<\/a> earlier this year, Google Search Advocate John Mueller suggested there are \u201cindirect\u201d effects based on E-A-T. That means if you convey it more strongly than other sites, your content may get a ranking bump.\r\n\r\nEstablishing E-A-T effectively can be tricky, but here are a few ways to do it:\r\n<ul>\r\n     <li>Show professional credentials through author bios or pages<\/li>\r\n     <li>Bring in external authority for quotes<\/li>\r\n     <li>Include peer reviews from a credible expert in the field<\/li>\r\n     <li>Display positive user, customer, or client reviews<\/li>\r\n     <li>Include citations and\/or works cited<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n<h3>6. Check the SERP Before You Write<\/h3>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"video-container\"><iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/-KPnMaXIoxs\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen><\/iframe><\/div>\r\n\r\nUnless your brand is incredibly well known and your website carries a massive level of authority (and even then...), it\u2019s not enough to just publish a page and then hope the right people happen to find their way there. \r\n\r\nBefore you commit to a keyword, search it to see what pages Google has already rewarded with page one placement. Your SERP analysis should clue you into a few key insights:\r\n<ol>\r\n     <li>What the searcher is expecting to find and click on<\/li>\r\n     <li>Types of websites winning for the keyword<\/li>\r\n     <li>Existing content and potential information gaps<\/li>\r\n     <li>Optimal keyword phrasing<\/li>\r\n     <li>Number of ideas (for list posts)<\/li>\r\n<\/ol>\r\nLet\u2019s say you\u2019re publishing content around home furnishings and you\u2019re looking to highlight couches. You think a post on \u201ccouch styles\u201d would align with your authority, be useful to readers, and allow you to promote in-house products. \r\n\r\nA search of the phrase \u201ccouch styles\u201d looks like this:\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/07\/expertise-trustworthiness.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1400\" height=\"1050\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-28929\" \/>\r\n\r\nThe SERP gives these insights (based on the list above):\r\n<ol>\r\n     <li>The searcher is expecting to find list posts<\/li>\r\n     <li>Lifestyle blogs, magazines, and brands are winning for the query<\/li>\r\n     <li>Since these are list posts, their depth is variable<\/li>\r\n     <li>Based on title tags, the more viable keyword actually seems to be \u201csofa styles\u201d<\/li>\r\n     <li>The top post has 25 ideas, with the average number ranging from 15 to 18<\/li>\r\n<\/ol>\r\nOnce you have a clearer, more grounded idea of what real users are typing into their search bar and clicking on, you\u2019re ready to start outlining and writing content that matches their expectations (and Google\u2019s).\r\n\r\n<h3>7. Write Like a Reader<\/h3>\r\n\r\nThink about the last time you looked something up on Google. When you found pages you thought might answer your query, how did you engage with them? Did you read each one start to finish? \r\n\r\nSeems doubtful. As much as we (or maybe just I) want to believe everyone reads every last word of what we write, the fact is, users are more likely to cherry-pick the information they want from a post. (As you may be doing with this very piece.)\r\n\r\n<div class=\"video-container\"><iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/Lh2ryMqrPtk\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen><\/iframe><\/div>\r\n\r\nContentsquare <a href=\"https:\/\/contentsquare.com\/insights\/digital-analytics-benchmarks\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">reported in 2021<\/a> that the average time users spend on webpages for all industries is 54 seconds. (If you\u2019ve read this far, you\u2019ve already well exceeded that time on this page.) \r\n\r\nAlso in 2021, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.orbitmedia.com\/blog\/blogging-statistics\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Orbit Media<\/a> found the average blog post is about 1,400 words long. If the <a href=\"https:\/\/psyarxiv.com\/xynwg\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">average reading rate<\/a> is 238 words per minute, that means the average blog takes about 5.9 minutes to read. You do the math.\r\n\r\nHere are a few ways you can meet readers where they are:\r\n<ul>\r\n     <li>Keep sentences clear and concise (ideally no longer than two lines)<\/li>\r\n     <li>Try to keep paragraphs under four lines or so<\/li>\r\n     <li>Never stuff with unnecessary filler just to meet an arbitrary word count<\/li>\r\n     <li>Organize your content so users can easily hop around the page to get the information they want<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n<h3>8. Keep It Scannable<\/h3>\r\n\r\nIn some ways, <a href=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/seo\/post-structure-for-seo\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">the way your post is structured<\/a> matters as much as what\u2019s in it. A content writer has to meet users where they are and be mindful of their reading habits (or lack thereof). Consider these three examples.\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/07\/post-structure-scannability.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1400\" height=\"1670\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-28933\" \/>\r\n\r\n<a href=\"https:\/\/www.semrush.com\/blog\/anatomy-of-top-performing-articles\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">SEMrush<\/a> found that of the 1.2M posts they studied, posts that utilized H2s, H3s, and H4s to guide their structure saw the highest levels of traffic and engagement. Let\u2019s dig into both elements.\r\n\r\n<h4>How Scannability Increases Webpage Traffic<\/h4>\r\nObviously, would-be visitors don\u2019t know how your page is structured before they click the link in the SERP. But structuring your content with a logical line of headings and subheadings (and even sub-subheadings) helps ranking for a few reasons:\r\n<ul>\r\n    <li>It relays the purpose of the post to Google more accurately<\/li>\r\n    <li>It shows Google which search queries it could answer<\/li>\r\n    <li>It promotes better user experience, which can increase engagement, which encourages higher ranking<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\nThat SEMrush study also found <b>posts with at least one list every 500 words gained nearly 75% more traffic than those that didn\u2019t<\/b>. Example: this very section.\r\n\r\n<h4>How Scannability Increases Website Engagement<\/h4>\r\n\r\nOn a practical level, headers help keep content structured, focused, and scannable, which encourages visitors to stay, scroll, read, and click links.\r\n\r\nLet\u2019s say someone comes to your immaculately researched, expertly written 5,000-word post on dog breeds to learn about proper nutrition for their pit bull. \r\n\r\nIf they can\u2019t easily spot a) a header on pit bulls, and ideally b) a subheader on feeding, you can expect them to hit the Back button and look elsewhere. \r\n\r\nSee for yourself. Which one of these do you think the hypothetical pit bull parent above would rather use?\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/07\/unoptimized-vs-optimized-structure.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1400\" height=\"870\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-28939\" \/>\r\n\r\n<h3>9. Link Up<\/h3>\r\n\r\nGoogle becomes aware of new webpages through the process of \u201cURL discovery.\u201d According to <a href=\"https:\/\/developers.google.com\/search\/docs\/advanced\/guidelines\/how-search-works\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Google's developer guide<\/a>, webpages can be discovered when you submit a sitemap, but they also get discovered when Google follows links on known pages.\r\n\r\nThat means linking your content to other content on your website can help them get discovered. \r\n\r\nWhen you add hyperlinks to your copy, it\u2019s important to write anchor text (the copy that gets hyperlinked) that\u2019s relevant to the destination page. \r\n\r\nYou can do this by aligning your anchor text as closely as possible to the destination page\u2019s URL\/slug, title, or target keywords. (Ideally, the same phrase should apply to all three.) Just be careful to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.searchenginejournal.com\/how-and-when-to-diversify-your-anchor-text\/51425\/\" target=\"_blank\" your anchor rel=\"noopener\">diversify your anchor text<\/a> so you aren\u2019t repeating the same keyword again and again for the same URL.\r\n\r\nIncluding relevant hyperlinks to your content within your content also allows users to easily move through multiple pages of your website. That means more engagement, more time on your site, and \u2014 ultimately \u2014 better rankings.\r\n\r\n<h2>Other Types of SEO Content<\/h2>\r\n\r\nFor the purposes of this post, most uses of the word \u201ccontent\u201d are in reference to written\/text media \u2014 generally blog posts. But there\u2019s more to SEO content than just SEO blog writing. Here\u2019s a non-comprehensive list.\r\n<ul>\r\n     <li><b>Keyword-Driven Blog Posts:<\/b> Published regularly to a single feed on a website, these can be long-form or short-form and either timely or evergreen to align with an ongoing content publishing strategy.<\/li>\r\n      <li><b>List Posts:<\/b> Also known as listicles, this is a common type of post that typically features plenty of images and is great for providing ideas, inspiration, and product options.<\/li>\r\n     <li><b>Landing Pages:<\/b> Hosted as standalone webpages and not as part of a blog, these are designed to bring visitors to a site and usually feature a clear call to action like a sale, newsletter sign-up, promo code offering, or download.<\/li>\r\n     <li><b>Pillar Content & Multi-Page Guides:<\/b> For complex subjects, it can be helpful to have one central page dedicated to a broad topic that links out to multiple in-depth pages on related subtopics.<\/li>\r\n     <li><b>Infographics:<\/b> This type of content condenses complex ideas into a single image combining copy with illustrations and\/or photos.<\/li>\r\n     <li><b>Videos:<\/b> Either embedded locally or hosted on a platform like YouTube or Wistia, this includes screen-share walkthroughs, presentations, animations, narrative films, etc. For some queries, Google may prioritize videos or pages that include them.<\/li>\r\n     <li><b>Downloadable Files:<\/b> This less common format includes PDFs, Word documents, spreadsheets, images, and other downloadable files. These can be offered to users as templates, manuals, whitepapers, lengthy visual guides, or printable materials like labels, decor, activities, and games.<\/li>\r\n     <li><b>Interactives:<\/b> <a href=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/creation\/interactive-content\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Interactive content<\/a> like calculators, text generators, quizzes, maps, and flowcharts allow users to (as the name suggests) interact with the content itself.<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n<h2>SEO Copywriting vs. Content Writing<\/h2>\r\n<img src=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/07\/seo-copywriting-vs-content-writing.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1400\" height=\"550\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-28935\" \/>\r\n\r\nBecause <a href=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/services\/copywriting\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">copywriting<\/a> and content writing serve similar promotional functions (and possibly because both start with a \u201cC\u201d), they can be easy to confuse. \r\n\r\nThink of copy as text meant specifically for advertising which generally doesn\u2019t provide standalone value to readers.\r\n\r\nContent, in addition to providing marketing value to the brand, should also provide readers with information, inspiration, instruction, or other important values that may or may not start with the letter \u201cI.\u201d\r\n\r\n<h2>Conclusion: What SEO Writing Is & Isn\u2019t<\/h2>\r\n\r\nAccording (again) to <a href=\"https:\/\/youtu.be\/rTcLkRkfkPs?t=1431\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Google's John Mueller<\/a>, the publishing website as a whole factors into ranking individual pieces of content. So even if you publish the best, most useful content on your topic, it can only rank consistently if the rest of your website is optimized.\r\n\r\nGetting content to rank on Google requires you to follow <a href=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/strategy\/on-page-seo\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">on-page SEO<\/a> and general SEO best practices, like optimizing images, improving layout, increasing website speed, maintaining a clean URL structure, using keywords appropriately, etc.\r\n\r\nBut that only matters if you\u2019re creating content worth clicking on.\r\n\r\nAs search algorithms get better at understanding user behavior, writing for search engines increasingly means writing for users. At its best, good SEO writing is just plain good writing. One end always serves the other.\r\n\r\nAs marketers, we\u2019re the curve reaching for that elusive 45-degree up-and-to-the-right line on a graph. For us, that means using every <a href=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/services\/content-marketing\" target=\"_blank\" marketing rel=\"noopener\">content marketing service<\/a> at our disposal to provide useful information people want \u2014 or even need \u2014 to engage with."

But, if your ROI calculation results in a number greater than zero, you at least broke even on your investment.\r\n\r\nWhen we\u2019re evaluating a potential client, we like to see our ROI estimates between 300-400% (3x to 4x), if not more, to have confidence in our work being value additive.\r\n\r\nOne consideration that isn\u2019t priced into many ROI estimates, but should be in actual ROI calculations, is the lifetime value of a piece of content in your industry. If your content is consistently driving traffic and conversions for three+ years, your ROI will therefore be much higher than what you estimated on a 12-month timeline.\r\n<h2>How To Calculate Content Marketing ROI?<\/h2>\r\nDepending on your business model, your method for estimating and calculating ROI may be slightly different. There are a few nuances to consider before modeling your returns from content:\r\n<h3>What Is Content Worth in Your Industry?<\/h3>\r\nA simple way to estimate the value of a piece of content in your industry is to take the traffic value of a top competitor, then divide that by the number of content pieces on their site.\r\n\r\n<i>Traffic value is a metric from Ahrefs that is the monetary value placed on organic traffic via keywords that people would bid on in PPC ads.\u00a0<\/i>\r\n\r\nIf you have an accurate valuation of what a piece of content is worth based on your own existing content, that\u2019s great \u2014 but if not, you should identify the value of content in your market by analyzing your top competitors.\r\n\r\nAt Siege, we do this for clients by reviewing some top competitors and averaging the traffic value for the top 50 pieces of content. We believe using the traffic value from the top 50 pages of a competitor\u2019s blog or learn center is comparable to the types of content we would create for them.\r\n\r\n<img class=\"alignnone wp-image-28703 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/06\/ahrefs-page-traffic-value-example.png\" alt=\"top traffic value for content marketing ROI in ahrefs top pages view\" width=\"1412\" height=\"1076\" \/>\r\n\r\nIt\u2019s worth noting that if your initiatives include more than landing page content, you can broaden this analysis to the root domain instead of just \/blog\/, \/learn\/, or \/resources\/ routes.\r\n\r\nIt\u2019s also worth noting that the process of projecting content marketing ROI is opaque at best. We use traffic value from Ahrefs as a directionally accurate metric, but with the full understanding that it is not exactly correlated with revenue and ROI.\r\n\r\nIf content doesn\u2019t appear super valuable at first glance, you might consider researching <a href=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/seo\/link-value-by-market\">what a link is worth in your market<\/a>.\r\n<h3>What Is Organic Traffic Worth to Your Business?<\/h3>\r\nIf you don\u2019t trust traffic value as reported by Ahrefs, or it simply doesn\u2019t feel like the right metric for your business (that\u2019s fair!), there is another way, as long as you have a firm grasp on what organic traffic means to you in terms of conversions and revenue.\r\n\r\nIn that case, you can instead identify the average <i>organic traffic<\/i> to content in your industry and run the numbers based on your conversion rate and the average order value (AOV) or average contract value (ACV).\r\n\r\nLet\u2019s say that the average piece of content in your market drives 500 organic visitors per month, and you\u2019ve consistently converted 2% of visitors into customers with an AOV of $100. This would mean that the average post drives $1,000 per month. If you were to publish five posts per month, by the end of 12 months you would have 60 posts published and then drive $60,000 per month in revenue from content, on average.\r\n<h3>What Is Your Time Horizon?<\/h3>\r\nContent and SEO are a long game.\r\n\r\nIt can take anywhere from nine to 18 months or longer for you to break even and start seeing returns on your investments. One thing to keep in mind is that while your expenses are likely increasing month over month, assuming more and more <i>high-quality<\/i> content is published. Results should begin to compound in later months to catch up and exceed expenses.\r\n\r\nThis means you most likely won\u2019t see results begin to bear fruit until six+ months and will start to approach a break-even point around month 12+:\r\n\r\n<img class=\"alignnone wp-image-28704 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/06\/organic-traffic-growth-projections-over-time_alternative.png\" alt=\"organic traffic projections for 12 months compared to expected revenue ROI\" width=\"1412\" height=\"1210\" \/>\r\n<h2>Estimating ROI: Competitor Analysis in Content<\/h2>\r\nThe first and most approachable way to estimate your content\u2019s ROI is to identify the average value of content using your top competitor.\r\n\r\nA natural starting point is by comparing apples to apples in terms of the type of content you plan to produce over the course of your content marketing campaign. Take the average monthly traffic and traffic value, as reported by Ahrefs. Then include the number of content pieces you plan to execute per month, as well as your monthly budget\/spend to project growth in traffic and traffic value.\r\n\r\nIt\u2019s also important to understand that a top competitor might have established authority in the space and can rank more easily for highly competitive keywords and therefore derive more value on average.\r\n\r\nIf that\u2019s the case, you can take your competitor\u2019s current performance and discount it accordingly to arrive at a reasonable expected ROI based on your current domain rating.\r\n<h2>Calculating ROI: Specific to Your Business Model<\/h2>\r\nIn content marketing, we typically face two broad business models:\r\n<ol>\r\n \t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\">Direct Traffic Monetization<\/li>\r\n \t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\">Traffic Conversion Monetization<\/li>\r\n<\/ol>\r\nThe first, what we'll call \u201cDirect Traffic Monetization,\u201d is any business whose revenue is linearly correlated with traffic \u2014 usually an advertising model.\r\n\r\nThe second is a business that must convert traffic into a lead or customer, so revenue is only loosely correlated with traffic. If you're measuring the ROI of <a href=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/strategy\/b2b-content-marketing\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">content marketing for B2B companies<\/a>, for example, it\u2019s important to understand how your traffic converts into leads and your win rate for turning leads into customers. Once you have that information, you can calculate ROI based on your average contract value (ACV).\r\n\r\nAn <a href=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/seo\/e-commerce\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">e-commerce site<\/a>, on the other hand, simply uses its conversion rate paired with its AOV to identify the value of traffic and generate an ROI calculation.\r\n<h2>Increasing Your Content Marketing ROI<\/h2>\r\nThere are a few strategies we strongly recommend our clients implement to increase ROI from content marketing:\r\n<ul>\r\n \t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\">Leverage SEO and <a href=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/seo\/blog-best-practices-seo\">blog design best practices<\/a>.<\/li>\r\n \t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\">Conduct a <a href=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/strategy\/kob-analysis\">KOB analysis<\/a> to prioritize high-value, low-difficulty keywords.<\/li>\r\n \t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\">Execute high-quality content that aligns with search intent.<\/li>\r\n \t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\">Audit content performance and update on an annual or semi-annual basis for <a href=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/seo\/freshness-distance\">freshness<\/a>.<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\nUltimately, we believe that content marketing is much more than simply written content. It should have a <a href=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/creation\/interactive-content\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">great user experience<\/a> to elevate perceived trust while improving the chances of your content creating conversions.\r\n\r\nIf you\u2019d like a more in-depth ROI analysis for your content marketing efforts or need to level-up your overall content strategy and quality, we\u2019re more than happy to identify the strategies that will deliver the most ROI for your business. <a href=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/business-form\">Reach out to us here<\/a>!"

    "title": "What Is Interactive Content? 12 Examples Worth the Effort",
    "content": "Interactive content is any content users can manually interact with and change. Calculators, generators, quizzes and tools are all examples of interactive content that will change as you input or update values for the end user.\r\n\r\nThis content is extra valuable because it gets users engaged with your brand, and that\u2019s much harder to do with plain text. Once you have consumers moving around your website and using it, you\u2019re that much closer to them making a purchase.\r\n\r\nAt Siege, we create dozens of interactive content assets for our clients each year. The value of those assets amount to over <b>$90,000,000 in yearly traffic value.<\/b>\r\n\r\nIn this post, we\u2019ll share when you should create interactive content (and when you shouldn\u2019t), best practices for creation and 12 high quality examples to inspire your next project.\r\n<h2>Who Needs Interactive Content?<\/h2>\r\nYou need interactivity if your content requires it. You don\u2019t need to add interactivity if your content doesn\u2019t.\r\n\r\n<img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-28615\" src=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/interactiviy-flowchart.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1401\" height=\"1401\" \/>\r\n\r\nThe risk to avoid with interactive assets is adding it for the sake of adding it. That leads you down a path of expensive, inefficient content that sparkles, but doesn\u2019t actually have value for the end user.\r\n\r\nInteractivity should be an element you end up knowing you need. Are your users going to need to do complex calculations? A calculator would add value. Is it unclear what the best option is for them in a complex decision tree? A quiz could be helpful.\r\n\r\nYou also want to tie interactives to existing demand, ideally in the form of search volume.\r\n\r\nThe only thing worse than interactivity for the sake of it is interactivity tied to something people don\u2019t want.\r\n\r\nIf you\u2019re using keyword research tools such as Ahrefs or Semrush to determine people clearly want something interactive, you not only confirm that reality, but you also set yourself up for the return on investment required by interactive content.\r\n\r\nOtherwise, you\u2019re making a guess that you can get it in front of enough people to make it worthwhile. This is still possible, it just adds further risk to the sometimes-costly equation.\r\n<h2>Interactive Content Benefits<\/h2>\r\nInteractive content isn\u2019t for everyone. As mentioned above, it can take a long time and be expensive to create. However, just like <a href=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/creation\/content-creation\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">creating any great content<\/a>, it has significant upsides.\r\n\r\nHere are a few:\r\n<ul>\r\n \t<li>Interactives are often high converting. Once users start engaging, it\u2019s much easier to get them to take the action you want. This is often described as the <a href=\"https:\/\/medium.com\/@daverosenburg\/close-more-sales-with-yes-set-ddc3479816d7\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">\"Yes Set\" technique<\/a>.<\/li>\r\n \t<li>Interactives generate a high number of passive links. Even if they don\u2019t convert a high number of users, they\u2019re magnets for link building and can almost single-handedly power your link acquisition strategy. For example, we can see all the links NerdWallet generates to their calculators below.<\/li>\r\n \t<li>Interactives have a competitive barrier to entry. It\u2019s not that hard for someone to get a writer on Upwork to create content for their WordPress blog. It is significantly harder to build a calculator with good UX. This can differentiate you from competitors in a way that\u2019s difficult to replicate, should you be willing to make that jump.<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n<h2>12 Interactive Content Examples<\/h2>\r\nThe following 12 examples show the gamut of ways interactive content, one of the most <a href=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/marketing\/creative-content\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">creative content types<\/a>, can add value to your website. From calculators to quizzes to generators, there\u2019s something for everybody.\r\n\r\nEach of these assets were created by the Siege team for our great clients.\r\n<h3>1.

You can make this happen by pre-filling inputs based on location or common responses, not requiring extra steps to see results, and also placing the calculator above the fold.<\/li>\r\n \t<li><b>Consider how you can re-use the codebase.<\/b> In some instances, you may be able to reuse the codebase for interactives you create. This makes the justification of creating them a lot easier as your future content creation costs will be significantly less than the first.<\/li>\r\n \t<li><b>Consider how you can lower maintenance time.<\/b> Some interactive tools will break with small tweaks to your code. You ideally have developers who think this through in advance, but it\u2019s realistic that most interactive tools will require maintenance to stay up and running, and stay useful over time.<\/li>\r\n \t<li><b>Heavily test on mobile devices.<\/b> Interactive tools are where the desktop to mobile connection is most likely to break. Test on every browser and every mobile device possible to confirm you are truly delivering on a great user experience.<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\nAll in all, interactive content is worth an immediate investment, especially if you identify consumer problems that require interactivity to solve them.\r\n\r\nBuilding this content requires great UX design, front end development resources and marketing strategy to put it all together. It\u2019s not simple, but that\u2019s why it\u2019s worth it.\r\n\r\nIf you don\u2019t have all of that in house, get in touch about <a href=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/services\/content-creation\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">our content creation services<\/a> today.\r\n<h2>Listen to the Podcast<\/h2>\r\n<div class=\"video-container\"><iframe title=\"YouTube video player\" src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/rdVr3m3WoD0\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"><\/iframe><\/div>\r\n<iframe src=\"https:\/\/player.simplecast.com\/bc6b9685-523b-4020-8e65-1d4ad34e0c67?dark=false\" width=\"100%\" height=\"200px\" frameborder=\"no\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless=\"\"><\/iframe>\r\n\r\n[podcast-cta itunes=\"https:\/\/podcasts.apple.com\/us\/podcast\/interactive-content-everything-you-need-to-know\/id1289467174?i=1000565306801\" stitcher=\"https:\/\/www.stitcher.com\/show\/content-and-conversation-seo-tips-from-siege-media\" spotify=\"https:\/\/open.spotify.com\/episode\/2PMlivy9bnGOxbdylGlxcQ\"]"

    "title": "Why We Stopped (Most) Manual Link Building After 1M+ Emails",
    "content": "Siege Media started as a link building agency sending thousands of targeted cold emails each month and continued with that process for a decade. After a lot of deliberation and data analysis, we\u2019ve realized that manual link building doesn\u2019t make sense for 90%+ of the companies we help.\r\n\r\n<div class=\"video-container\"><iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/0GIPqlJeqdY\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen><\/iframe><\/div>\r\n\r\nTo understand how we came to this conclusion, it might be helpful to hear the backstory.\r\n\r\nAt the beginning of Siege Media\u2019s development 10 years ago, our biggest focus was link generation for our clients. We created manually promoted linkbait, very often without any attachment to search volume.\r\n\r\nOver time, we incorporated more and more search-volume-driven content into what we do. We realized this performed better because it created on-brand content and generated secondary KPIs, not just links.\r\n\r\nAfter seeing this method bear fruit, we then realized this content was generating a huge number of passive links. On a long enough timeline, the numbers <a href=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/marketing\/cost-per-link-analysis\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">often far outpaced<\/a>  the initial manual push we gave the assets. \r\n\r\n<img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-21627\" src=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/cpl-analysis-2.png\" alt=\"link growth chart\" width=\"1400\" height=\"591\" \/>\r\n\r\nThis started getting our brains turning on the type of posts that generated more passive links than others. We started emphasizing these for clients, often early in engagements \u2014 and got better at it over time.\r\n\r\nAll the while, Google started moving towards a brand-focused approach. It is hard, if not impossible, to rank unless you truly have quality content to offer.\r\n\r\nThe \u201cfake\u201d approaches of manipulating your link volumes without a quality product attached to it dried up. If you didn\u2019t have good content, no amount of skill at generating links would make up for it. \r\n\r\nThis meant that the winners were almost always products that had product\/market fit and were attracting a level of quality links by nature of what they were doing.\r\n\r\n<h2>Outreach Compared to Non-Outreach<\/h2>\r\n\r\nIn Siege\u2019s model, which we\u2019ve repeatedly tested over time, the main difference between SEO-driven content and those that add outreach is double the time needed, even though the effective quality is relatively similar.\r\n\r\nWhy is that?\r\n\r\nWhen we create content for outreach, we often add shareable design assets to keyword-driven content, such as <a href=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/services\/graphic-design\">infographics or data visualizations<\/a>. These visuals specifically make it easier for outside websites to link back to a post. Then, we spend time doing outreach specifically. \r\n\r\nThis means that we essentially double the time to complete a successful outreach campaign. But if we weren\u2019t thinking about outreach, it\u2019s arguable that we\u2019d still include those shareable assets in the content to solve for search intent (even though we'd still include other high-quality design elements).\r\n\r\n<b>So, in essence, we were cutting our content productivity in half by deciding we would promote something manually without any major increase in content quality.<\/b> No bueno.\r\n\r\n<h2>Client Splits Offering Data Confidence<\/h2>\r\n\r\nDuring this period, we effectively took on three client types: One that needed help with outreach tied to content, one with a hybrid of non-outreach content and outreach content, and one where we created SEO-driven content without outreach.\r\n\r\nThe main reason we didn\u2019t do any outreach for some clients is because their brands had a strong Domain Rating (DR) position. So, it was obvious from the start that a few extra manual links would do very little for them.\r\n\r\nIn this model, all of our time and attention went to content creation. \r\n\r\nIn seeing a few of these case studies, the results are pretty striking:\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/ahrefs-content-creation-2.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"396\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-28407\" \/>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/ahrefs-content-creation-3.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"396\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-28408\" \/>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/ahrefs-content-creation-1-updated.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"396\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-28501\" \/>\r\n\r\nOf course, we understand that the highest authority sites are naturally going to see better results, so it\u2019s not causative that less manual outreach caused these outcomes.\r\n\r\nThis said, most businesses would be ecstatic with a fraction of the above results, especially the top two. We realized we were onto something.  \r\n\r\n<h2>Enter KOB Analysis<\/h2>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"video-container\"><iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/bZe771lsU6c\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen><\/iframe><\/div>\r\n\r\nIn recent years, we\u2019ve more heavily emphasized <a href=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/strategy\/kob-analysis\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Keyword Opposition to Benefit Analysis<\/a>.\r\n\r\nThrough this process, we are able to prioritize low-difficulty topics that could generate links and add value for our clients early in the engagement. \r\n\r\nBy leaning on this, we realized that we could generate initial traction even for middle-authority clients without doing manual outreach, not just DR leaders like the above. \r\n\r\n<h2>Content Hub Design and Internal Links<\/h2>\r\n\r\nTo add to that, we started adding extra emphasis on internal linking and content hub design. \r\n\r\nHere are some of the checklist items we made sure every client had, or eventually worked towards, for their <a href=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/services\/blog-design\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">blog design<\/a>:\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n     <li>The content section linked in the top navigation.<\/li>\r\n     <li>15+ links were present on the content hub and content hub categories.<\/li>\r\n     <li>3+ related links to relevant posts post-content.<\/li>\r\n     <li>5+ links were added from old content to every new post.<\/li>\r\n     <li>Passive link generators prioritized in internal linking.<\/li>\r\n     <li>A high-quality hub and blog post design.<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n\r\nIn this situation, even if the content got \u201cstuck\u201d around the top of page two, we knew the client\u2019s product\/market fit would mean it\u2019d eventually get pushed over the hump via a few more links based on the quality of their product \u2014 if all of the above checkboxes were accurately hit. \r\n\r\nFrom there, if the content and <a href=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/seo\/blog-best-practices-seo\">content experience<\/a> were truly high quality, they would start attracting passive links to accelerate growth. \r\n\r\n<div class=\"video-container\"><iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/3tMLpFuCDBo\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen><\/iframe><\/div>\r\n\r\nPreviously, we effectively made up for scalable solutions by trying to fix the problem with a hammer \u2014 manual outreach. \r\n\r\nIn seeing a larger sample size, we realized these were things that we could solve with a better strategy and dedication towards improving infrastructure issues.\r\n\r\n<h2>Manual Outreach vs. Content-Only Approaches<\/h2>\r\n\r\nWhen we realized the time was right to shift to this new approach, we started bringing it to clients who were on our old model of doing heavy manual outreach. \r\n\r\nThese were clients doing a lot of outreach-focused content in the middle-authority range but seeing some initial traction.\r\n\r\nIn making the pitch, we projected the difference using market expectations and the idea that in an outreach model, we\u2019d probably see some faster results due to quicker links. However, we\u2019d eventually lose out to a model that would allow us to create more, better content with that time. \r\n\r\nAs mentioned above, we\u2019d be able to double production of the same quality content by not doing outreach. Or we could focus on better content, content updates, blog design, or many other things that we believe would be the better use of that time.\r\n\r\nThis is a version of that graph with adjusted X and Y axes:\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/03\/roi-passive-link-building-vs-manual-siege-media.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1400\" height=\"749\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-28183\" \/>\r\n\r\nThe client agreed, and we put the change to the test. We only had three months or so of the previous strategy with more outreach but had done enough to see a notable difference in the impact of the two approaches.\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/passive-link-strategy-traffic-value-example.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"396\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-28409\" \/>\r\n\r\nAs you can see, around January 2022, the graph accelerates upward. Again, there can be several factors contributing to this, but this was a perfect example of a middle-authority business with product\/market fit and initial traction. For that reason, it made sense to lean into this new strategy.\r\n\r\nWe hope to update this post over time with more \u201cbefore\/after\u201d clients that shifted from one model to the other. The above is the first (early) example of our new process in action while also comparing the old one.\r\n\r\n<h2>Where Manual Outreach Makes Sense<\/h2>\r\n\r\nAlthough we realized using the above analysis that high-volume manual outreach doesn't make sense for 90% of situations, how do you know you\u2019re not in the remaining 10%?\r\n\r\nThe following are a few ways we still see it making sense:\r\n<h3>Brand New Websites<\/h3>\r\n\r\nIf you\u2019re a brand new website <a href=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/strategy\/content-marketing-for-startups\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">or startup<\/a> that knows SEO is going to be a primary distribution channel, accelerating your path to returns through manual outreach can make sense.\r\n\r\nThis said, we suggest you only pursue SEO at product\/market fit (very often Series A), as an early strategy may often need to pivot due to changes in positioning. Also, you often don\u2019t have the luxury of waiting 12\u201324 months to rank if you have limited runway.\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/Spending-Budget-By-Startup-Stage-1.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1400\" height=\"1016\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-27904\" \/>\r\n\r\nWith that said, it\u2019s possible product\/market fit is a lot less flexible in some situations (for example, a finance product review site or someone selling solar panels). \r\n\r\nHere, it could make sense to start your SEO strategy with a push using outreach to accelerate your timeline, depending on if the adequate resources are available. \r\n\r\n<h3>High Link Value With PR Benefits<\/h3>\r\n\r\nIn some verticals, the value per link is astronomical. This is often because there is less search volume in the content marketing area, and the nature of the business means people rarely link out.\r\n\r\nAs an example, in <a href=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/seo\/link-value-by-market\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">our post breaking this down<\/a>, CardRatings has a $44,000+ value per link:\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/common-lifetime-link-value-equation-siege-media-updated.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1400\" height=\"942\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-28543\" \/>\r\n\r\nHere, there is clearly a strong ROI argument to do quality manual outreach \u2014 most often via Digital PR \u2014 even if you can be successful without it.\r\n\r\nHowever, we\u2019d still recommend these approaches be tied to brand awareness plays that actually have incremental value. Any activity that purely has links as a KPI has a probability of being stamped out by Google in the future, if it hasn\u2019t been already.\r\n\r\nAs a general threshold, <b>it may be worth considering above $10,000 lifetime value per link<\/b>.\r\n\r\n<h3>Targeted, High-Leverage Outreach<\/h3>\r\n\r\nOutreach still has huge value. It\u2019s just when you try to stretch out the returns it has relative to other activities you could spend that time on where its value gets called into question.\r\n\r\nIf you can keep outreach high leverage, it is still worth doing. What are some examples?\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n     <li><b>Brand link reclamation -<\/b> You can often <a href=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/seo\/what-is-link-building\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">generate links<\/a> <$200 CPL in an effective timeframe if your brand is getting mentioned a lot without being linked to. Due to the low cost against potential return, these links make sense to keep pursuing.<\/li>\r\n     <li><b>Ego bait or influencer inclusions -<\/b> If you include influencers in your content, the distribution leverage they can offer against the time spent is often quite high. This relationship-building still makes sense and will continue to in the future.<\/li>\r\n     <li><b>High-impact digital PR -<\/b> As mentioned above, if your company is building a big report, launching news, or anything else, the return on your individual press pitches are going to be high. That said, there\u2019s a difference between pitching your Series D launch once a year and a crappy piece of linkbait that is just one of many in any given month. It\u2019s understanding this line that will allow you to maximize returns.<\/li>\r\n     <li><b>Nudging high link intent topics for low authority sites -<\/b> If you see a topic that can generate 1,000+ links on a long enough timeline, it often warrants the manual push to get it ranking faster and more reliably. Even if the topic could rank without your nudge, getting it ranking faster could generate links you wouldn't have generated otherwise, and it also should solidify your ability to do that.<\/b><\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n\r\n<h2>Philosophy Changes Mindset<\/h2>\r\n\r\nThe returns on paper clearly make sense to us for 90% of our clients.\r\n\r\nThere are also \u201csoft benefits\u201d we expect to see from this due to a philosophy change.\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n     <li>Undoubtedly, links from this method are future-proof and what Google wants to reward as compared to those generated from manual outreach.<\/li>\r\n     <li>A mindset shift from our teams away from individual link outcome goals to overall qualified traffic lifts and content quality. <\/li>\r\n     <li>A focus on on-site strategy and site conversions compared to a link building (or <a href=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/strategy\/off-page-seo\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">off-page SEO<\/a>) strategy should help teams focus on the things that matter.<\/li>\r\n     <li>The belief that less outreach also means more fulfilled content marketers. This should drive retention and better client understanding through the duration of the account and net volume of content creation and research done over time.<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n\r\nAlthough we\u2019ll stop tracking individual links, we believe a continued focus on link velocity does make sense. \r\n\r\nWe\u2019ve recently started adopting an \u201c<b>average link per blog visit<\/b>\u201d metric that looks at how many visits per link is normal for each industry we work in. In extrapolating that out to how many visits we expect to grow our clients, we can set macro link goals using Ahrefs\u2019 link velocity numbers. \r\n\r\n<img src=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/06\/average-link-per-blog-visit-siege-media.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1400\" height=\"1400\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-28634\" \/>\r\n\r\nA major reason we love this approach is not because we believe less in links, <b>it\u2019s that we can generate even more of them<\/b>. We have <a href=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/work\/casper-content-marketing\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">legit case studies generating 200+ links\/month<\/a> for clients, and that\u2019s only possible with this methodology.\r\n\r\n<h2>A Strategic Recap<\/h2>\r\n\r\nTo sum things up, by doing the following, we believe we can generate great content marketing results for 90%+ of the SEO-driven websites that are out there without outreach:\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n     <li>Validate that the website has product\/market fit and is naturally acquiring some links and is showing initial search traction.<\/li>\r\n     <li>Improve the content hub and content post template to be best in class in the industry.<\/li>\r\n     <li>Optimize internal linking for the content hub section to an A+ standard.<\/li>\r\n     <li>Remove low performing content with no traffic, links or conversions.<\/li>\r\n     <li>Start engagements with low difficulty, high passive link volume content.<\/li>\r\n     <li>Continue to build best-in-class content using SEO best practices, copy, design and development.<\/li>\r\n     <li>Prioritize passive link earners in the site architecture.<\/li>\r\n     <li>Ladder up to high difficulty topics over time using KOB Analysis.<\/li>\r\n     <li>Continue to measure and improve macro link velocity over time.<\/li>\r\n     <li>Continue to focus on creating assets that can drive passive links.<\/li>\r\n     <li>Use the time we spent on outreach to instead focus on things like macro content hub improvements, content updates, and improved content quality.<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n\r\n<h2>How We Got Here<\/h2>\r\n\r\nIt was a scary decision to almost completely eliminate doing something we had done for a decade.\r\n\r\nThough everyone may not agree, and I understand in some ways, this may put into question the entire business model of some SEO companies. That may be controversial. \r\n\r\nAs we\u2019ve evolved at Siege over the past ten years, we\u2019ve tried to stay ahead of the curve. This has meant making difficult decisions to continue to drive the best results for our clients. \r\n\r\nThis is one of our biggest changes yet, but by every indication and data point we\u2019re looking at, it\u2019s also one of the clearest. \r\n\r\nWe\u2019re excited about this next phase of Siege Media and what it means for better spending our time on building a better web, not just a few more links. I hope doing so may help a few more of you do the same.\r\n\r\n<h2>Listen to the Podcast<\/h2>\r\n\r\n<iframe height=\"200px\" width=\"100%\" frameborder=\"no\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless src=\"https:\/\/player.simplecast.com\/7c3978d2-ca5b-46df-9ba7-941c638f5723?dark=false\"><\/iframe>\r\n\r\n[podcast-cta itunes=\"https:\/\/podcasts.apple.com\/us\/podcast\/why-we-stopped-most-manual-link-building-after-1m-emails\/id1289467174?i=1000564886274\" stitcher=\"https:\/\/www.stitcher.com\/show\/content-and-conversation-seo-tips-from-siege-media\" spotify=\"https:\/\/open.spotify.com\/episode\/1jddFVrR3uSIQAnnEPVl5H\"]\r\n"

    "content": "You might be surprised to learn that E-A-T is not technically one of Google\u2019s ranking factors. But that doesn\u2019t mean it won\u2019t provide value that can significantly improve your SEO rankings.\r\n\r\nIn August 2018, Google\u2019s algorithm updates took a turn that the SEO community couldn\u2019t ignore.\r\n\r\nOften referred to as the \u201cMedic\u201d update, this series of algorithm changes began noticeably rewarding sites that excelled in E-A-T.\r\n\r\nEven if you\u2019re new to SEO and haven\u2019t yet heard the acronym E-A-T floated around, there\u2019s a good chance you understand the gist of it.\r\n\r\nWe are a 120-person SEO agency that has helped companies with some of the best E-A-T in the world, like Casper and Intuit, reach new heights. In just six months, we <a href=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/work\/casper-content-marketing\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">increased Casper\u2019s organic traffic by 280%<\/a>. Through partnerships like this, we\u2019ve developed a sharp eye for what it means to have good E-A-T.\r\n\r\nRead on for a full rundown of what E-A-T is, why it matters for SEO purposes and how you can implement excellent E-A-T into your organization\u2019s strategy.\r\n<h2>What Is E-A-T?<\/h2>\r\n<blockquote class=\"definition\">\r\n<h3>E-A-T<\/h3>\r\n<p class=\"phonetic\">[i-e\u026a-ti] <em>noun<\/em><\/p>\r\nE-A-T stands for Expertise, Authority and Trustworthiness. These characteristics are used by Google to determine the authenticity and quality of a web page in an effort to minimize misinformation on the internet.\r\n\r\nWhile E-A-T isn\u2019t a ranking factor \u2014 that is, it isn\u2019t a quantifiable criterion Google uses to determine whether a page should rank \u2014 E-A-T still matters to Google. A lot.<\/blockquote>\r\nE-A-T comes from Google\u2019s <a href=\"https:\/\/static.googleusercontent.com\/media\/guidelines.raterhub.com\/en\/\/searchqualityevaluatorguidelines.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Search Quality Rater Guidelines<\/a> \u2014 a 168-page document used by human quality raters to assess the quality of Google\u2019s search results.\r\n\r\nGoogle published this document online in 2013 to help webmasters understand what Google looks for in a web page, though it wasn\u2019t until 2018 that Google started explicitly rewarding great E-A-T, catching the attention of the SEO community.\r\n\r\nE-A-T is not easy to establish, but putting time and effort into doing it well is worth it for both the short and long-run.\r\n<h2>The E-A-T Acronym, Broken Down<\/h2>\r\nWhen you hear the words expertise, authority and trustworthiness, you may think of them as near synonyms.\r\n\r\nWhile they are related and play into one another, each of these terms carry nuances that are important to understand individually to help you set specific and measurable E-A-T goals.\r\n<h3>Expertise<\/h3>\r\nIf you\u2019re operating a website within a particular industry, you\u2019d probably consider yourself an expert in that industry, right? Even if that\u2019s a reasonable assumption for you, it isn\u2019t for Google \u2014 you have to prove it.\r\n\r\nExpertise means to have a high level of knowledge or skill in a particular field.\r\n\r\nWhat signals tell Google that it should see you as particularly knowledgeable or skilled in your field?\r\n\r\nThis could look like sharing your credentials on your site, spending years consistently writing in a certain vertical or partnering with other experts.\r\n\r\nIt\u2019s also important to note that expertise will look different depending on your industry and the topic at hand.\r\n\r\nGoogle splits topic types into two categories, which we\u2019ll explore in greater detail later: YMYL and non-YMYL. YMYL stands for \u201cYour Money or Your Life\u201d and essentially encompasses any topic that can have an impact on people\u2019s health and wellbeing.\r\n\r\n<img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-28257\" src=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/expertise-for-ymyl-topics-1.png\" alt=\"Banner saying &quot;Expertise for YMYL topics&quot; to introduce the following section\" width=\"1400\" height=\"203\" \/>\r\n\r\nFor most <a href=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/seo\/ymyl\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">YMYL topics<\/a>, Google wants to see content creators with more formal and concrete credentials \u2014 think education, certifications and other forms of formal expertise.\r\n\r\nIf you work in a technical field like cybersecurity, for example, it\u2019s important that Google sees some schooling or training that qualifies you to write about the topic.\r\n\r\nHere is snippet from a page that discusses a YMYL topic, but fails to assert its expertise:\r\n\r\n<img class=\"alignnone wp-image-28232 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/expertise-for-ymyl-topics.png\" alt=\"Snippet from a site offering health advice demonstrating bad E-A-T\" width=\"1400\" height=\"531\" \/>\r\n\r\nGoogle considers nearly every health-related query to be a YMYL topic. The above post is titled \u201cAmazing Health Benefits of Carrots\u201d \u2014 an explicitly health-related query. Therefore, Google should hold it to a high standard of E-A-T.\r\n\r\nThe above page not only fails to back up its claims with data, but it also has not been reviewed by medical experts \u2014 both E-A-T necessities when writing about a health-related topic.\r\n\r\nFurther, the author claims to operate in the restaurant business. While this may give them some credibility when writing about a carrot soup recipe on a food blog, it doesn\u2019t establish their authority to write about a topic in health.\r\n\r\nFor these reasons, the page is struggling to rank.\r\n\r\n<img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-28256\" src=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/expertise-for-non-ymyl-topics-1.png\" alt=\"Banner saying &quot;Expertise for non-YMYL topics&quot; to introduce the following section\" width=\"1400\" height=\"203\" \/>\r\n\r\nFor non-YMYL topics, Google defines expertise differently \u2014 often in the form of life experience as opposed to formal qualifications.\r\n\r\nGoogle\u2019s Quality Rater Guidelines specifically state: \u201cIf it seems as if the person creating the content has the type and amount of life experience to make him or her an \u2018expert\u2019 on the topic, we will value this \u2018everyday expertise\u2019 and not penalize the person\/webpage\/website for not having \u2018formal\u2019 education or training in the field.\u201d\r\n\r\nIf you\u2019re a lifestyle travel blogger who regularly posts your adventures and insights, for example, Google will likely see you as a travel expert even if you don\u2019t have formal training or a certification saying you\u2019re an expert. You\u2019re a seasoned traveler, and that\u2019s good enough.\r\n\r\nFor example, when Googling \u201cEurope backpacking checklist,\u201d a couple\u2019s travel blog ranks position two on the SERP. See a snippet from this site\u2019s \u201cAbout\u201d page below.\r\n\r\n<img class=\"alignnone wp-image-28231 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/expertise-for-non-ymyl-topics.png\" alt=\"Travel blog \u201cAbout Us\u201d page listing travel experience to demonstrate good E-A-T\" width=\"1400\" height=\"819\" \/>\r\n\r\nThis blog has terrific E-A-T, not because the couple boasts any education in culture, travel or international studies, but because they have experience. For non-YMYL topics, this is all Google needs to classify a site as an expert.\r\n\r\n<strong>Examples of expertise:<\/strong>\r\n<ul>\r\n \t<li>Formal education in your subject matter described in your author bio<\/li>\r\n \t<li>Mentions of your experience with the subject matter throughout blog content to back up claims<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n<h3>Authoritativeness<\/h3>\r\nAuthoritativeness goes a step beyond expertise. To be trusted as an authority in a certain space, you have to be more than an expert \u2014 you have to be a thought leader.\r\n\r\nDo the insights you share on your website not only express an understanding of your field, but also actively contribute to its development and evolution?\r\n\r\nCurious what an inadequate effort at authority looks like? See the example below.\r\n\r\n<img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-28235\" src=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/inadequate-authoritativeness.png\" alt=\"Snippet from \u201cAbout\u201d page demonstrating bad E-A-T by failing to communicate credentials and details\" width=\"1400\" height=\"589\" \/>\r\n\r\nAlthough this author identifies herself as an entrepreneur and \u201cThe Elderberry Queen,\u201d her bio does not provide any quantifiable insights that back up her authority.\r\n\r\nTo improve her authority, she could specify how many years she has been experimenting with elderberry syrup, speak to research that has been done on the syrup\u2019s health benefits or mention a book she has written on her area of expertise.\r\n\r\nNext, let\u2019s take a look at a great example of authority in the SEO space. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.searchenginejournal.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Search Engine Journal<\/a> has become a source of truth and a go-to resource for SEO news, thanks to its age (launched in 2003) and its extensive community of online marketing experts located all around the world.\r\n\r\n<img class=\"alignnone wp-image-28227 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/adequate-authoritativeness.png\" alt=\"Snippet from Search Engine Journal\u2019s \u201cAbout\u201d page demonstrating good E-A-T by discussing credentials and experience\" width=\"1400\" height=\"651\" \/>\r\n\r\nEven further, think about Google itself \u2014 there\u2019s no authority in the search engine space higher than Google. After all, it literally makes the rules.\r\n\r\nWhile you shouldn\u2019t expect yourself to become the Google of your industry, there\u2019s a lot to be learned from industry leaders about what it looks like to be an authority.\r\n\r\n<strong>Examples of authoritativeness:<\/strong>\r\n<ul>\r\n \t<li>User reviews, expert recommendations and other credible insights written by individuals that provide information about the website<\/li>\r\n \t<li>Signals of reputation, such as awards and accolades or involvement in current controversies\/events<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n<h3>Trustworthiness<\/h3>\r\nTrustworthiness is all about consistency. Are you impressing your customers and site visitors every time, or has your trustworthiness slipped through the cracks?\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, second chances for brands are rare. Delivering false information or inconsistently living out your brand\u2019s mission could result in a tarnished reputation and reduced trust in the eyes of your customers and Google.\r\n\r\nA great way to develop trustworthiness is to be transparent from the start.\r\n\r\nTake Bankrate, for example. It provides readers with a disclaimer that calls attention to its editorial standards, how it makes money and the potential that its content will become outdated.\r\n\r\n<img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-28236\" src=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/trustworthiness.png\" alt=\"Snippet of disclaimer from Bankrate expressing transparency and quality, demonstrating good E-A-T\" width=\"1400\" height=\"419\" \/>\r\n\r\nBy communicating this \u201cimperfection,\u201d users are more inclined to see the brand as humble, authentic and trustworthy.\r\n\r\n<strong>Examples of trustworthiness:<\/strong>\r\n<ul>\r\n \t<li>Sufficient contact information<\/li>\r\n \t<li>Precision and accuracy of content<\/li>\r\n \t<li>Citation of trustworthy sources<\/li>\r\n \t<li>Information about content authors<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n<h2>How Google Determines Your E-A-T<\/h2>\r\nE-A-T communicates site quality to Google and users alike, which makes sites that invest in E-A-T more likely to attract traffic, accumulate links and ultimately rank on the SERP organically.\r\n\r\nTo determine E-A-T, Google deploys a team of Search Quality Raters that are tasked with evaluating ranking sites following every algorithm update (and there are a lot of updates \u2014 dozens per day, in fact).\r\n\r\nThese Search Quality Raters are the judges of your site\u2019s E-A-T. They refer to Google\u2019s extensive <a href=\"https:\/\/static.googleusercontent.com\/media\/guidelines.raterhub.com\/en\/\/searchqualityevaluatorguidelines.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Search Quality Evaluator Guidelines<\/a> to decide where you stand.\r\n\r\nThese guidelines lay out what Google means by E-A-T:\r\n<ul>\r\n \t<li>The expertise of the creator of the Main Content.<\/li>\r\n \t<li>The authoritativeness of the creator of the Main Content, the Main Content itself, and the website.<\/li>\r\n \t<li>The trustworthiness of the creator of the Main Content, the Main Content itself, and the website.<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\nAs you can see, Google takes a comprehensive look at not just your site and its content, but also the authors of that content.\r\n\r\nOf course, the specifics of E-A-T can still feel confusing at times. SEO and E-A-T expert <a href=\"https:\/\/lilyray.nyc\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Lily Ray<\/a> discusses what it should mean to impress Google with an E-A-T strategy.\r\n\r\n<img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-28237\" src=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/what-is-eat-lily-ray.png\" alt=\"Quote from E-A-T expert Lily Ray clarifying the question \u201cWhat is E-A-T?\u201d and explaining what it means to improve E-A-T\" width=\"1400\" height=\"1144\" \/>\r\n<h2>Why Does Google Care About E-A-T?<\/h2>\r\nImagine you\u2019re interested in taking out a loan and are looking for financial advice online.\r\n\r\nAs you comb through the articles on the first page of the SERP, all you see are small blogs run by individuals without financial degrees. When you open a page, you see stream-of-consciousness opinions about what you should do with your money. No Investopedia, no NerdWallet.\r\n\r\nThat wouldn\u2019t fly.\r\n\r\nE-A-T is one of Google\u2019s tools to ensure this doesn\u2019t happen. Google has a social responsibility to surface pages that provide readers with accurate and useful information.\r\n\r\nIn Google\u2019s 2019 white paper titled \u201c<a href=\"https:\/\/www.blog.google\/documents\/37\/How_Google_Fights_Disinformation.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">How Google Fights Disinformation<\/a>,\u201d it specifies, \u201cWe have an important responsibility to our users and to the societies in which we operate to curb the efforts of those who aim to propagate false information on our platforms.\u201d\r\n\r\nPeople often make life-altering decisions based on what they read online, so surfacing content that fails to meet E-A-T criteria could pose a risk to people and their communities. This would damage the trustworthiness of Google itself and potentially the communities it serves.\r\n\r\nThis holds especially true for topics that inform important decisions, which brings us back to YMYL.\r\n<h3>Revisiting YMYL<\/h3>\r\n\u201cYour Money or Your Life,\u201d or YMYL, is a classification Google uses for content that can directly impact users\u2019 financial wellbeing, physical and mental health, safety and happiness.\r\n\r\nSo how does E-A-T come into play here?\r\n\r\nAccording to Google, \u201cWe have very high Page Quality rating standards for YMYL pages because low-quality YMYL pages could negatively impact a person\u2019s happiness, health, financial stability, or safety.\u201d\r\n\r\nEssentially, Google holds YMYL pages to the highest level of scrutiny with regard to E-A-T because this content can have the most direct impact on its users\u2019 lives.\r\n\r\nRanking misleading or poor content within this space could have a seriously negative impact on user health and safety.\r\n\r\n<img class=\"alignnone wp-image-28238 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/what-is-ymyl-eat.png\" alt=\"Four E-A-T meters demonstrating to what degree E-A-T matters for various topics\" width=\"1400\" height=\"1429\" \/>\r\n\r\nYou can probably think of some industries and categories that Google groups into this category. Here\u2019s a list of the pages most often classified as YMYL, according to Google:\r\n<ul>\r\n \t<li><strong>Finance.<\/strong> Sites that offer financial advice should have the expertise and trustworthiness to inform users\u2019 monetary behavior.<\/li>\r\n \t<li><strong>Shopping.<\/strong> In the same vein, <a href=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/strategy\/ecommerce-statistics\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">e-commerce statistics<\/a> show that online storefronts as well as sites providing information about shopping research must prove their validity.<\/li>\r\n \t<li><strong>News and public information.<\/strong> Misinformation about politics, current events, etc., can both directly and indirectly harm people\u2019s quality of life.<\/li>\r\n \t<li><strong>Medical and safety.<\/strong> Sites that offer guidance regarding physical and mental health perhaps have the most direct impact on people\u2019s health and safety.<\/li>\r\n \t<li><strong>Government and law.<\/strong> If a page informs readers about the law, local politics, voting and the like, it\u2019s essential that it provides up-to-date and accurate information.<\/li>\r\n \t<li><strong>Associations.<\/strong> Pages making claims about people based on qualities such as ethnicity, race, nationality, religion, age, disability, gender and gender identity, sexual orientation or veteran status are closely monitored to protect users.<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\nGoogle also considers sites and pages related to \u201cbig decisions or important aspects of people\u2019s lives\u2026 such as fitness and nutrition, housing information, choosing a college, finding a job, etc.\u201d as YMYL.\r\n\r\nIn an interview, Google\u2019s <a href=\"https:\/\/www.searchenginejournal.com\/googles-john-mueller-stresses-importance-of-e-a-t-for-ymyl-websites\/400605\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">John Mueller<\/a> confirmed the importance of prioritizing E-A-T for YMYL topics, saying, \u201c...Especially for medical topics, anything that\u2019s a little more critical, I would also keep in mind everything around the E-A-T. So the expertise, authoritativeness, and trustworthiness.\u201d\r\n<h2>So Why Isn't E-A-T a Ranking Factor?<\/h2>\r\nWith all the time and attention Google puts into determining a site\u2019s E-A-T, you might assume it to be one of Google\u2019s notorious ranking factors.\r\n\r\nHere\u2019s why it technically isn\u2019t.\r\n\r\nE-A-T can\u2019t be measured by a single metric \u2014 it requires a comprehensive look at several factors, such as author expertise, site quality, and overall brand image. For this reason, E-A-T can\u2019t be considered a direct ranking factor.\r\n\r\nHowever, indirectly, it works almost exactly the same as a ranking factor. The process just looks different.\r\n\r\nGoogle\u2019s Search Quality Raters look at authors and site authority signals to inform Google\u2019s algorithm, which ultimately helps pages with better E-A-T rank.\r\n\r\nIf those pages have additional positive signals (i.e., lots of relevant backlinks), this can help Google verify the site\u2019s E-A-T and continue to rank it above other competitors.\r\n\r\nSo there you have it \u2014 even though it isn't <em>technically<\/em> one of Google's ranking factors, Google rewards excellent E-A-T. Next, to help you earn Google's trust, we'll walk through some strategies to elevate your E-A-T.\r\n<h2>7 Ways to Improve Your E-A-T SEO<\/h2>\r\n<img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-28276\" src=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/improving-your-eat-seo-no-title-1.png\" alt=\"List of seven tips for improving E-A-T next to an illustrated pencil and notepad\" width=\"2801\" height=\"1973\" \/>\r\n\r\nIf you aren\u2019t confident your site has established sufficient E-A-T, don\u2019t stress. There\u2019s always an opportunity to build it. In fact, establishing E-A-T should be an ongoing process, and you should never settle for \u201cgood enough.\u201d\r\n\r\nLet\u2019s take a look at some proven ways you can start enhancing your E-A-T and proving to Google that you deserve to be on top of the SERP.\r\n<h3>1. Flaunt What You\u2019ve Got<\/h3>\r\nAs we\u2019ve established, Google loves expertise. If you have it, don\u2019t be shy \u2014 make it known!\r\n\r\nPerhaps you have a team of certified experts informing your content, or maybe you\u2019ve been working in your industry for 10+ years and know the ins and outs of even the most technical topics.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"https:\/\/www.healthline.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Healthline<\/a>, for example, recognizes the importance of expertise as a part of a YMYL industry (health). It publicly communicates that doctors and other certified medical professionals have reviewed medical content before publishing.\r\n\r\n<img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-28258\" src=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/healthline-author-bio-example.png\" alt=\"Callout of Healthline\u2019s certification that content has been reviewed by medical professionals to demonstrate trustworthiness\" width=\"1400\" height=\"393\" \/>\r\n\r\nOne great place to communicate your E-A-T is on your site\u2019s <a href=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/creation\/about-us-page-examples\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">About Us page<\/a> or equivalent. It\u2019s the page that users (and Search Quality Raters) who want to learn about your organization will gravitate toward.\r\n\r\nThis provides an opportunity to put your achievements, authenticity and authority in your space front-and-center. This might look like:\r\n<ul>\r\n \t<li>Awards your organization has won<\/li>\r\n \t<li>Education\/certifications of your team<\/li>\r\n \t<li>Appearances in relevant publications<\/li>\r\n \t<li>Books or projects you\u2019ve created<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\nConsider Hubspot, for example. In a sleek, clear and non-intrusive way, the company communicates its extensive presence and impact.\r\n\r\n<img class=\"alignnone wp-image-28226 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/about-us-page.png\" alt=\"Snippet of HubSpot\u2019s \u201cAbout\u201d page communicating the company's credentials, resources, successes and authority\" width=\"1400\" height=\"902\" \/>\r\n<h3>2. Build Links Strategically<\/h3>\r\nWhile links from anywhere might have helped boost your E-A-T in the past, Google has gotten smarter.\r\n\r\nToday, building links should be more strategic.\r\n\r\nBefore reaching out to a site in an attempt to receive a backlink, consider whether the prospect makes sense for your industry. If you\u2019re a skincare brand, a link from a construction site likely won\u2019t improve Google\u2019s perception of your E-A-T.\r\n\r\nIn fact, Google makes an effort to penalize sites for collecting irrelevant links at scale. Back in 2014, yellowHEAD\u2019s Yonatan Dotan presented a <a href=\"https:\/\/moz.com\/blog\/a-startling-case-study-of-manual-penalties-and-negative-seo\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">case study<\/a> on Ginger Software, which received an influx of unsolicited spammy links from a variety of irrelevant sites. As a result, Google penalized the site\u2019s rankings and traffic.\r\n\r\nThis not only speaks to the importance of strategic link building, but also the need to carefully monitor your site\u2019s organic backlinks for suspicious activity.\r\n\r\nOf course, <a href=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/seo\/need-high-authority-links\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">highly authoritative<\/a> and relevant links are some of the best ways to communicate your authority to Google. But earning them requires a great deal of time and resources. You have to consistently create high-quality content that the right sites want to link to.\r\n<h3>3. Conduct Regular Content Refreshes<\/h3>\r\nEvergreen content is great. It stays relevant year-round and rarely (if ever) needs to be updated.\r\n\r\nHowever, there are a lot of content opportunities that aren\u2019t evergreen, such as seasonal topics and topics that are still evolving.\r\n\r\nFor example, a piece about the state of the electric vehicle industry will not stay relevant for long. The industry is in a state of rapid evolution.\r\n\r\n<img class=\"alignnone wp-image-28230 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/conduct-regular-content-refreshes.png\" alt=\"Callout of recent dates in results for the query \u201celectric vehicle industry\u201d on the first page of Google\" width=\"1400\" height=\"1067\" \/>\r\n\r\nAs you can see, when you Google \u201celectric vehicle industry\u201d there is very little content that was created or updated before 2021 on the front page. Google rewards freshness due to the nature of the industry.\r\n\r\nWhile it can be a great content strategy to capitalize on time-sensitive opportunities, it\u2019s equally important to keep them up-to-date.\r\n\r\nThis holds especially true for YMYL topics such as financial, legal and medical advice, where the information in an article can have a direct impact on readers\u2019 lives.\r\n\r\nLeaving outdated content on your site for too long will deteriorate your trustworthiness, ultimately harming your rankings. That\u2019s why we recommend conducting regular <a href=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/seo\/content-audit\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">content audits<\/a> to identify content refresh opportunities.\r\n<h3>4. Seek Expertise Externally<\/h3>\r\nIf you don\u2019t have in-house medical or mental health professionals to review your post on how herbal tea can relieve anxiety, don\u2019t panic. You still have opportunities to prove your expertise.\r\n\r\nExperts are out there \u2014 you just need to find them.\r\n\r\nConsider following groups on LinkedIn and Facebook that share insights about your industry, and reach out to thought leaders when you see their names mentioned.\r\n\r\nMany experts would be more than happy to provide a quote or a piece of advice about their topic of interest. It\u2019s a win-win situation \u2014 you bolster your E-A-T, and the expert gets more exposure.\r\n\r\nIf you\u2019re struggling to find a specific individual you\u2019d like to reach out to, you can also use tools to source quotes from several experts, then choose the quotes you find most useful.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/creation\/how-to-use-haro\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Help a Reporter Out<\/a> (HARO) is a great resource for doing just that. It allows you to customize a query and request a specific type of expertise to make sure you get the most relevant and useful information possible.\r\n\r\nYou also don\u2019t need a fresh, new quote to bolster the expertise of your piece. Lots of organizations conduct studies on niche topics related to their industry.\r\n\r\nTry sourcing relevant data from those studies to show readers (and Google) that you\u2019ve done your research.\r\n<h3>5. Audit Your Brand<\/h3>\r\nWhat do people (and search engines) think of you?\r\n\r\nThis will require some digging \u2014 asking your employees or co-workers how they perceive your brand won\u2019t cut it. There\u2019s bound to be a pretty massive discrepancy between internal and external perceptions of your brand.\r\n\r\nInstead, here are a few impactful brand audit tips to try:\r\n<ul>\r\n \t<li><strong>Audit your site.<\/strong> Do your homepage, your \u201cAbout\u201d page and your blog all communicate that you\u2019re an authority in your space? Are you transparent about why customers should trust you? As previously mentioned, you shouldn\u2019t be shy about your credentials \u2014 they make you trustworthy!<\/li>\r\n \t<li><strong>Survey your customers.<\/strong> You might feel that your website communicates an excellent brand image, but your customers may not agree. You can expect your users to provide much more accurate data. Use a tool like <a href=\"https:\/\/www.usertesting.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">UserTesting.com<\/a> to ask customers how trustworthy they feel your site is. Consider asking about their trust in your brand, the words they associate with your site and whether your brand image is aligned with what you deliver.<\/li>\r\n \t<li><strong>Analyze your online presence.<\/strong> What are people saying about your brand unprompted? When Googling your brand, what are publications, competitors and bloggers saying about you? It doesn\u2019t matter if you believe this perception to be inaccurate \u2014 it\u2019s how people see you. If their perception is unfavorable, it might be time to adjust your brand strategy.<\/li>\r\n \t<li><strong>Improve customer experience.<\/strong> When you improve your customers\u2019 experience, you improve your brand image. Make it as easy as possible for users to navigate your site, receive answers to their questions and contact you. The better you anticipate your customers\u2019 needs, the more trustworthy you become.<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n<h3>6. Build Your Content Strategy Around E-A-T<\/h3>\r\nUnfortunately, E-A-T is often an afterthought in the <a href=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/services\/content-creation\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">content creation<\/a> process.\r\n\r\nMany of us are guilty of thinking, \u201cWhy don\u2019t we source a last-minute quote to make our post look a little better?\u201d\r\n\r\nWhile sometimes, you\u2019ll be able to find a great quote or data point to make your piece appear to have more expertise, Google (and many readers) can see through this, especially if done in place of an E-A-T strategy.\r\n\r\nEffective E-A-T requires forethought, planning and consistency. If you have a SOP detailing your content creation process, add a step to source relevant quotes and\/or data before the writing process has started.\r\n\r\nRemember, trustworthiness is all about consistency, and what better way to ensure consistency than to bake your E-A-T strategy right into your day-to-day content creation process?\r\n\r\nPolicyGenius does a great job of anticipating its skeptical users\u2019 questions regarding its legitimacy and trustworthiness.\r\n\r\n<img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-28229\" src=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/build-your-content-strategy-around-eat.png\" alt=\"Callout of PolicyGenius\u2019 \u201cWhy you can trust our sources\u201d box to demonstrate trustworthiness\" width=\"1400\" height=\"547\" \/>\r\n\r\nHover over the superscript citation markings and you see a link saying \u201cWhy you can trust our sources,\u201d which directs users to its editorial and citation standards.\r\n\r\nPolicyGenius anticipates that users looking at sources want to verify their validity, so it places links to its trustworthiness commitment wherever it cites data. This is a great example of integrating E-A-T into an overall strategy rather than sprinkling it in sporadically.\r\n<h3>7. Attract Reviews and Engage<\/h3>\r\nReviews don\u2019t just provide insight into what you as an organization should improve \u2014 they also send signals to Google. Numerous positive reviews communicate to Google that your customers trust you.\r\n\r\nBut what about negative ones?\r\n\r\nWhile several negative reviews obviously aren\u2019t good for your brand image or E-A-T, responding to negative reviews communicates that you care about customer wellbeing and does positively impact trustworthiness.\r\n\r\nTake the following response to a customer\u2019s negative review of their stay at the Stamford Plaza in Brisbane, for example.\r\n\r\n<img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-28228\" src=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/attract-reviews-and-engage.png\" alt=\"Callout of manager\u2019s great response to mediocre hotel experience review to demonstrate how to respond to reviews\" width=\"1400\" height=\"1521\" \/>\r\n\r\nThe manager responds with empathy and kindness, uses positive language (\u201cconstructive\u201d rather than \u201cnegative\u201d) and communicates that action has been taken to improve moving forward.\r\n\r\nEngagement with all reviews \u2014 positive and negative \u2014 is a great idea. It humanizes your brand and makes customers feel cared for. A great response might even convince a customer to change their negative or mediocre review.\r\n\r\nYou should also note a <a href=\"https:\/\/developers.google.com\/search\/blog\/2021\/04\/product-reviews-update\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">recent update<\/a> from Google that aims to improve the rankings of sites with more complex and detailed reviews \u2014 reviews that really help other customers make purchase decisions.\r\n\r\nWhen inviting reviews, encourage customers to share their full experience. This might include images or videos, which tend to speak louder than words.\r\n<h2>Time to E-A-T<\/h2>\r\nLike many aspects of SEO, E-A-T can feel intangible and perplexing at times. You may not notice an immediate cause-effect relationship between the steps you take to improve your E-A-T and your rankings.\r\n\r\nAbove all else, E-A-T is an investment in your brand image. Impress your customers and Google will be soon to follow.\r\n\r\nAs you work toward becoming an authoritative figure in your space, start by writing a killer <a href=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/creation\/author-bio\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">author bio<\/a> that echoes your expertise."

Start with Audience Research<\/h2>\r\n\r\nOne of the biggest content marketing tips that will make an impact on your business is to start with audience research. Of course, everyone wants their content to rank for the biggest terms, but if you start your content journey by conducting keyword rather than audience research, you risk targeting terms that are difficult to rank for and have relatively low conversion rates.\r\n\r\nBy starting with audience research, you\u2019ll be able to get to know your ideal customer on a deeper level, find the keywords they actually use and even create buyer personas that you can map each piece of content to.\r\n\r\nTo conduct proper audience research, you can use tools like <a href=\"https:\/\/sparktoro.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">SparkToro<\/a> or <a href=\"https:\/\/www.brandwatch.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Brandwatch<\/a> to learn where your audience hangs out, the hashtags and phrases they use most often and what media they consume to make sure your content matches their preferred style.\r\n\r\nFocus on what your audience would actually search for in each stage of the buyer's journey if you really want to create valuable and <a href=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/creation\/high-converting-content\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">high-converting content<\/a>.\r\n\r\n<blockquote class=\"definition\"><strong>Pro Tip:<\/strong> Your audience wants to see themselves represented in your content and walk away feeling that it was made with them in mind. Use <a href=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/marketing\/diversity-equity-inclusion\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) marketing<\/a> best practices to accomplish this.<\/blockquote>\r\n\r\n<h2 id=\"prioritize-efforts-by-roi-frameworks\">2. Prioritize Efforts by ROI Frameworks<\/h2>\r\nWhen planning your editorial calendar, you\u2019ll first need to understand how much it\u2019ll cost you to create content and get links. This will help you determine what projects to prioritize because depending on your industry, some will have a higher ROI than others.\r\n\r\nConsider the following frameworks for your industry to help determine what content marketing strategies to move forward with first.\r\n\r\n<b>Ratio of content creation<\/b>\r\n<ul>\r\n     <li>Check out your competitors. How much content are they creating every month? Do you need to have a high-content ratio to bring in traffic, or can you lower your scope without risking your audience? If you see competitors doing well with a low ratio of content creation, you can follow a similar strategy.<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n<b>Cost per link<\/b>\r\n<ul>\r\n     <li>You can determine <a href=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/seo\/link-value-by-market\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">how much links are worth<\/a> in your industry by dividing the traffic value of your competitors by their total links. You can then compare that rate to how much it costs to create link-worthy content. This ratio will help you understand if links have enough ROI to be worth investing in.<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n<b>Keyword opposition to benefit analysis<\/b>\r\n<ul>\r\n     <li>Here at Siege, we strongly believe that every content marketing strategy should start with a <a href=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/strategy\/kob-analysis\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">KOB<\/a>. We break down how to do this properly on our blog, but the benefits are worth restating. KOBs can help set you up for long-term success, leading to faster rankings with a lower amount of effort.<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n\r\n<h2 id=\"keyword-frameworks\">3. Leverage Keyword Frameworks<\/h2>\r\nThe smartest marketers know that <a href=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/seo\/seo-writing\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">writing SEO content<\/a> is about more than just keyword research. To truly meet your business goals, you need to create content that targets how people really search. Even if that means going against what the keyword research tools tell you.\r\n\r\nThe following keyword frameworks have been proven to drive traffic and leads in a variety of industries, because they target terms that readers really want to know.\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/03\/keyword-frameworks-that-drive-results-siege-media.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1400\" height=\"1984\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-28173\" \/>\r\n\r\nIf you pop any of these terms into a tool like <a href=\"https:\/\/ahrefs.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Ahrefs<\/a>, their low search volume (SV) may surprise you. While some may only have 5\u201310 searches a month, those searches are from readers at the bottom of the buyers funnel, and you can easily convert them by appearing at the top of the SERP.\r\n\r\nBy thinking ahead, you can rank for these types of terms before keyword tools even start to suggest them to you or show search volume for them (and trust us, SV is coming).\r\n\r\n<h2 id=\"create-a-passive-link-engine\">4. Create a Passive Link Engine<\/h2>\r\n\r\nSecuring links without conducting outreach is possible if you put your brand in the right position. This type of coverage is known as passive links, and you don\u2019t need to be a unicorn startup to take advantage of the SEO benefits of free press. All you need to do is leverage the information you already have.\r\n\r\nProprietary data is a goldmine for creating passive links. By targeting keywords in your industry that researchers often search for (such as \u201cstatistics,\u201d \u201cdata,\u201d \u201croundup,\u201d \u201ctrends\u201d or \u201ccalculator\u201d) you can get your internal data in front of those who will share that information with the public.\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/03\/roi-passive-link-building-vs-manual-siege-media.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1400\" height=\"749\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-28183\" \/>\r\n\r\nThis is a much more powerful strategy than just collecting third-party data, because most journalists will link out to the original source anyways.\r\n\r\nOnce you get a few of these internally-driven posts live on your site, make sure to link them to each other towards the top of each page. This will create a passive link engine that helps churn out top-tier coverage in a variety of topics, leading to better brand awareness over time.\r\n\r\n<h2 id=\"focus-on-low-time-to-value\">5. Focus on Low Time to Value<\/h2>\r\nPicture this: you spend thousands of dollars and hours on a big piece of high-quality content, only to see it fall flat in conversions and page views. We\u2019ve all been there. However, to really scale your content marketing efforts, putting a focus on lower lift and high-value content is crucial.\r\n\r\nLow time to value content includes:\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n     <li>Calculators with pre-filled information for ease of use<\/li>\r\n     <li>Content with subheaders above the fold to make the answer easy to find<\/li>\r\n     <li>Posts targeting keywords with high passive link intent<\/li>\r\n     <li><a href=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/creation\/content-curation\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Curated roundup posts<\/a> to build relationships with other bloggers<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n\r\nThe goal is to make your content as simple to understand and as interactive as possible, to boost user experience and keep them coming back for more. Check out an example of a pre-filled calculator below.\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/nerdwallet-low-time-to-value-calculator.gif\" alt=\"\" width=\"1400\" height=\"788\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-27732\" \/>\r\n\r\n<h2 id=\"build-visual-interest-into-your-thumbnails\">6. Make Thumbnails Varied<\/h2>\r\nA blog hub best practice that\u2019s smart to bake into your content creation process early is to diversify your thumbnails. While most brands just use standard <a href=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/marketing\/stock-photos\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">stock images<\/a> for their blog content, you can stand out from the crowd by bringing visual interest to your blog hub.\r\n\r\nThis can be done through illustrations, branded overlays, color blocking or even GIFS. Bonus points if you can tie each visual element to the topic at hand!\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/03\/help-scout-thumbnails.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1400\" height=\"929\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-28177\" \/>\r\n\r\n<h2 id=\"evaluate-for-freshness-distance\">7. Evaluate for Freshness Distance<\/h2>\r\n\r\nOn most SERPs, new content has an advantage over older articles. That\u2019s why keeping your content fresh by evaluating <a href=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/seo\/freshness-distance\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">freshness distance<\/a> \u2014 or the distance between the most recently updated and the oldest post on a given SERP \u2014 is so important.\r\n\r\nIf you\u2019re seeing your content fall on the older side of your freshness distance scale, it might be time to make some updates.\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/03\/freshness-distance-siege-media.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1400\" height=\"1044\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-28178\" \/>\r\n\r\nWhile we recommend updating all your content at least once a year, this timeline can shrink if Google deems newer content more worthy, so make sure you\u2019re watching the SERP behavior carefully.\r\n\r\nBy dedicating just a few hours to updating your older content, you can ensure your brand stays relevant and see huge long-term growth without much extra effort required from your content team.\r\n\r\n<h2 id=\"build-up-your-blog-index\">8. Build Up Your Blog Index<\/h2>\r\nHave you ever come across a blog index that only shows a few pieces of content? If so, you\u2019ve likely felt the pain of having to click through dozens of pages just to read a few articles.\r\n\r\nDon\u2019t do this to your readers. Instead, build up your blog index to include at least 15 posts on the first page. You can even add an \u201ceditor\u2019s pick\u201d or \u201cfeatured content\u201d section to your blog hub to help your most important content stand out.\r\n\r\nThis strategy will not only improve user experience and engagement by giving them more content options upfront, but it will also help reduce <a href=\"https:\/\/www.selesti.com\/knowledge-hub\/pagination-click-depth-and-seo#:~:text=The%20importance%20of%20click%20depth,-Definition%3A%20Click%20depth&text=Because%20click%20depth%20is%20among,to%20actually%20find%20the%20content.\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">click depth<\/a>, an important factor in how search engines understand your page's level of importance.\r\n\r\n<a data-leadbox-popup=\"1448b8f73f72a2:14ee417df346dc\" data-leadbox-domain=\"siegemedia.lpusercontent.com\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-27688\" src=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/11\/01-free-28-page-pdf-cta.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1400\" height=\"550\" \/><\/a>\r\n\r\n<h2 id=\"preview-proof-benefit\">9. Use the PPB Formula<\/h2>\r\nWe all know how important <a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=IgIzR2Z21nI\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">introductions<\/a> are for drawing in a reader. However, there are things you can do outside of the first line of copy to help increase credibility and time on-page. This is known as the PPB Formula, or Preview, Proof and Benefit.\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/03\/ppb-formula-siege-media.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1400\" height=\"1180\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-28179\" \/>\r\n\r\nFirst, you\u2019ll want to give your readers a <b>preview<\/b> of what your content is about. You can do this in several ways, including in a subheader underneath the title or in your first line of copy.\r\n\r\nIt's also important to show your audience <b>proof<\/b> of why they should trust you. This can be done through high-authority author bios or other <a href=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/seo\/what-is-eat\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">E-A-T<\/a> best practices.\r\n\r\nFinally, clearly explain the <b>benefit<\/b> to your readers. You\u2019ll need to explain what they\u2019ll get out of reading your content and why they should care. From learning the ins and outs of a complicated topic to how your tips have helped others be successful, there are plenty of ways to show benefit to your audience.\r\n\r\n<h2 id=\"focus-on-long-tail-keywords\">10. Focus on Long-Tail Keywords<\/h2>\r\nOutsmart the competition by focusing on long-tail keywords in your industry that are often easier to rank for while still bringing in relevant traffic.\u00a0\r\n\r\nThis is an especially good idea if you see immovable objects in the SERP for your head terms (such as .org or .gov websites, local or image packs and shopping carousels). Because more often than not, you won\u2019t be able to outrank them.\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/03\/short-tail-vs-long-tail-serps.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1400\" height=\"336\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-28208\" \/>\r\n\r\nBy taking a broad approach and focusing on the long-tail keywords that surround a given topic, you can rank at the top of the SERP and capture that same audience that you otherwise would\u2019ve missed.\r\n\r\n<h2 id=\"put-ctas-on-an-island\">11. Put CTAs on an Island<\/h2>\r\nCopy that stands on its own, stands out.\r\n\r\nWhen writing CTAs within your content, it's a good idea to put them on an island no matter if they\u2019re located in the middle or at the end of your article. \r\n\r\nThis will help draw the reader's eye and catch the attention of those just scanning your copy, meaning they\u2019ll be more likely to click than they would if you hid the CTA deep in a paragraph. \r\n\r\nEmbroker does a great job of this, like in the example below.\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/03\/ctas-on-island.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1400\" height=\"639\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-28180\" \/>\r\n\r\n<h2 id=\"create-multiple-posts-in-the-same-category\">12. Multiple Posts in the Same Category<\/h2>\r\nTo really show your expertise in a certain category, you\u2019ll need to spend a lot of time talking about it. That can mean publishing several pieces of content within the same category, to make sure you\u2019ve covered every facet of your industry.\r\n\r\nEach piece of content should also target a short-tail keyword and multiple long-tail variations, also known as <a href=\"https:\/\/www.searchenginejournal.com\/keyword-clusters-seo-content-strategy\/399414\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">keyword clusters<\/a>, to boost organic traffic and see faster ranking improvements.\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/03\/blog-structure-internal-linking-siege-media.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1400\" height=\"1480\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-28181\" \/>\r\n\r\nThe key to getting the maximum SEO benefit for these similar pages is to create a proper internal linking strategy. Similar posts should link to each other, both to increase time spent on site and to show Google what content is related.\r\n\r\nIt's best practice to aim for at least five internal links in each article, and to have that same article backlinked on at least five other internal pages. This will ensure that your readers (and Google) are able to find every single one of your pages.\r\n\r\n<h2 id=\"remove-unnecessary-sharing-buttons\">13. Remove Unused Sharing Buttons<\/h2>\r\nInstead of including sharing buttons for every social media outlet under the sun, take a moment to consider where your target audience really hangs out.\u00a0\r\n\r\nFor example, if you look at Google Analytics and discover that 99 percent of your social traffic comes from Twitter, why would you give readers the option to share on Facebook?\r\n\r\nAs marketers, sometimes we have to give our readers a little nudge in the right direction. And if you can help direct them to where these industry conversations are really happening while boosting your traffic and engagement, all the better.\r\n\r\n<h2 id=\"use-hybrid-title-tags-for-a-high-ctr\">14. Use Hybrid Titles For a High CTR<\/h2>\r\nWhen it comes to writing title tags, how do you balance keyword placement with attention-grabbing copy? While it may seem crucial for SEO to include your target keyword at the beginning of your title tag \u2014 think again.\r\n\r\nOver the years, Google has gotten hip to those trying to trick the system, and it now penalizes sites for over-optimization practices such as keyword stuffing. What does this mean, exactly? It means that you have to get smarter about your copy to solve for the reader and for Google all at once.\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/03\/how-to-create-hybrid-title-tags-siege-media.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1400\" height=\"1467\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-28206\" \/>\r\n\r\nThis is especially true for highly competitive SERPs, where you\u2019ll likely have to include adjectives like \u201cactionable\u201d or \u201cbest\u201d to help your post stand out to users. These adjectives aren\u2019t naturally found in many keywords you\u2019ll target, meaning you may have to bump your target keyword farther down the title.\r\n\r\nBut the good news is that Google will reward you for putting the user first, meaning a higher probability of moving up the SERP over time. Check out more information on title tags in our video \u201c<a href=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/seo\/title-tags\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">How To Write Title Tags That Rank<\/a>\u201d below.\r\n\r\n<div class=\"video-container\"><iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/LBYIkwsUts0\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen><\/iframe><\/div>\r\n\r\n<h2 id=\"create-evergreen-content\">15. Create Evergreen Content<\/h2>\r\nEvergreen content, or content that\u2019s relevant and useful to readers for a long period of time, is a no-brainer addition to your digital marketing strategy. Unlike content that capitalizes on current trends or passing fads, evergreen content is information that users are always looking for, and can help your business grow steady, long-term traffic.\r\n\r\nFor example, you can create content that helps break down industry jargon, touches on a recurring event or holiday or even shows readers how to do something.\u00a0\r\n\r\nAnother bonus? <a href=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/strategy\/evergreen-content\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Evergreen content<\/a> doesn\u2019t need to be updated as regularly as topical content does, so you can hit publish without worrying that you\u2019ll need to rewrite the whole post in just a few months.\r\n\r\n<h2 id=\"think-outside-the-blog\">16. Think Outside the Blog<\/h2>\r\nWhile blog posts are certainly every content marketer's bread and butter, a well-built marketing plan shouldn\u2019t stop there. Content <a href=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/creation\/types-of-content-marketing\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">can take on many forms<\/a>, but one tried and true strategy is to repurpose the same piece of content into multiple forms to help extend its usability.\r\n\r\nFor example, a long-form piece of content could get turned into smaller \u201cbites\u201d by sharing insights on a Twitter thread. \r\n\r\nYou could also take that same piece of content and create an <a href=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/creation\/why-and-how-infographics-work\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">infographic<\/a> or podcast episode about it, capturing visual and auditory learners who may not have read your piece otherwise. Bottom line: make sure your content has the right V.I.N.E.S.\r\n\r\nV.I.N.E.S. or Video, Images, News, Experts and Social is an acronym we created that helps highlight out-of-the-box research methods. By using these avenues when ideating content, you can expand your reach with ease.\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/keep-readers-entertained-vines-acronym.png\" alt=\"Make creative content by looking to video, images, news, experts, and social for inspiration.\" width=\"1401\" height=\"422\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-28038\" \/>\r\n\r\nHowever, it\u2019s important to be strategic when repurposing content in order to capture the right audience. \r\n\r\nYou\u2019ll likely need to make some adjustments to each piece to match what\u2019s successful on every platform, such as re-editing videos or turning a long infographic into several smaller images.\r\n\r\nBy rethinking and expanding the content lifecycle, you can cast a wider net without sacrificing much more time or effort from your content team.\r\n\r\nIf you're looking for more inspiration, visit our post on <a href=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/strategy\/content-marketing-examples\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">content marketing examples<\/a>.\r\n\r\n<h2 id=\"make-sure-your-content-solves-problems\">17. Make Content That Solves Problems<\/h2>\r\nAn important question to ask yourself when creating content is: \u201cWhat problem does this content solve for my target audience?\u201d If you aren\u2019t sure, it might be time to take a second look at what you're creating.\u00a0\r\n\r\n<b>Good content should either inform or solve a user problem, and great content should do both.<\/b>\r\n\r\nIf you\u2019ve done step one well, you\u2019ll likely already have an idea of the main questions your audience has in every stage of the buyer funnel. Use this information to create targeted posts that will help build trust with readers and get them that much closer to the buying stage.\r\n\r\nIf you haven\u2019t done audience research, take some time to get to know your audience\u2019s main pain points before you produce any more content to begin to see real results.\u00a0\r\n\r\nYou can accomplish this by digging into Reddit threads, YouTube comments and Facebook groups in your industry. Or, you can just send out a customer feedback form if you want information straight from the horse's mouth.\r\n\r\n<h2 id=\"promote-promote-promote\">18. Promote, Promote, Promote<\/h2>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/03\/marketing-advice-reddit.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1400\" height=\"529\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-28174\" \/>\r\n\r\nOnce you\u2019ve created a great piece of content, your work isn\u2019t over.

    "title": "Enterprise Content Marketing Strategy: Learn the Essentials",
    "content": "An effective enterprise content marketing strategy means finding ways to get out of your own way. If you can find a way to do that, you'll almost always win.\r\n\r\nHere at Siege, we help great enterprise brands grow with SEO. We\u2019ve worked with dozens of Fortune 1000 companies over the years, all with their own unique challenges and inefficiencies.\r\n\r\nIn this post, we\u2019ll break down the strategies we use to get things done within larger organizations, help you identify potential red flags that can derail your programs and also identify when it makes sense to raise the white flag.\r\n\r\n<div class=\"video-container\"><iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/wyekkKHKF90\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen><\/iframe><\/div>\r\n\r\n<h2>Create a Home Your Team Can Own<\/h2>\r\nIn enterprise organizations, website ownership gets broken down into smaller teams. This means getting things done comes down to fighting for change on areas of the website where teams have their own motivators.\r\n\r\nIn order to truly have an (almost) uninterrupted path forward, building a unique section of the site dedicated to your effort often makes sense. \r\n\r\nOf course, it needs to make sense for your content strategy, but if you were on the fence about, say, building a learning center for your company before, enterprise dynamics might really make you lean into doing that. \r\n\r\nThis is a common playbook for SEO teams where a blog may have several brand and creative owners who don\u2019t like seeing that kind of content conflict with their specific goals and messaging. \r\n\r\n<h2>An Easy-to-Use CMS is Critical<\/h2>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/suggested-cms-examples.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1400\" height=\"435\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-28139\" \/>\r\n\r\nYou have enough red tape at a big company \u2014 don\u2019t make your content management system (CMS) have another layer of it. \r\n\r\nIt\u2019s not uncommon for enterprise organizations to have custom content management systems, and unfortunately it\u2019s also not uncommon for those systems to be unwieldy and hard to use.\r\n\r\nFor a fast-moving content marketing strategy, defer to simplicity. If you\u2019re lucky enough to be able to carve out a unique section of the website, deploying a WordPress install on just that section can be beneficial for the most flexibility and user-friendliness moving forward. \r\n\r\nWe see many startups defer to the sexy CMS of the moment. Many of these come in waves of popularity, but in our experience WordPress continues to be the most consistent preference for flexibility, time to value and universal understanding by content marketers of the world. \r\n\r\nThey also have a <a href=\"https:\/\/wpvip.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">WordPress VIP<\/a> product for enterprise companies doing significant pageviews. <a href=\"https:\/\/webflow.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Webflow<\/a> and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.contentful.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Contentful<\/a> are both solid options should you prefer some of their features.\r\n\r\n<h2>Content Requires Several Roles<\/h2>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/the-several-roles-of-content-marketing.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1400\" height=\"800\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-28138\" \/>\r\n\r\nAt a startup, you may be able to write and edit a post end-to-end yourself.\r\n\r\nIn an enterprise organization, you have to have several layers of quality assurance. This increases costs and time required, but also solidifies the brand that got the organization to where it is today. Those dependencies are:\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n     <li>Professional editors<\/li>\r\n     <li>Art Directors (a design editor)<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n\r\nThese two editing roles are needed for content, whether contract or full-time. If you proceed without them, your content will eventually get flagged internally by creative teams. You\u2019d rather be prepared to meet brand requirements out of the gate rather than wake up to bigger issues once your content starts getting attention.\r\n\r\n<h2>Links Are Best Generated Passively<\/h2>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"video-container\"><iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/mxEzl81jS-4\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen><\/iframe><\/div>\r\n\r\nLinks matter, and they will continue to matter. That being said, generating them through manual outreach at the enterprise level as a content marketer rarely makes sense. There\u2019s a few reasons for that:\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n     <li>PR teams own reporter relationships.<\/li>\r\n     <li>There is more brand red tape around what you can or can\u2019t say, making on-brand linkable assets more difficult to create.<\/li>\r\n     <li>Enterprise website authority means you can actually generate a ton of links through ranking for top-funnel assets.<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n\r\nThe last bullet is the most important element of this. As a bigger company, you can typically rank pretty easily once you can actually get the content live. This means you can create a link building engine simply by ranking for strong top-funnel terms, especially if you lean into topics with strong link-to-view ratios.\r\n\r\nView our video above for more tips about how to do this for your company.\r\n\r\n<h2>Don\u2019t Accept Lack of Early Accountability<\/h2>\r\n\r\nSomething we see with frequency at bigger companies is that they start a content marketing campaign earnestly, often rarely caring about bottom-funnel sales metrics at the first phase of the effort. Brand awareness is a thing many large companies accept as a positive goal.\r\n\r\nThis may be justifiable for a time, but it\u2019s rarely sustainable. Even if leadership accepts traffic growth as an early indicator of success, you as a content marketer should be leaning into sales as a goal immediately. \r\n\r\nThis will inevitably lead to better sustainability for your campaign and longer-term budget increases for your department.\r\n\r\n<h2>Account for Existing Content<\/h2>\r\n\r\n<a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/bryanfcasey\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Bryan Casey<\/a>, Director of Digital Marketing at IBM, rolled out a successful content program that started slow. He realized that old content on the site (the green line) was actually weighing down perceived growth of the program, as he fought against the downtrend with new content (the blue line).\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/ibm-content-program-1.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"396\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-28140\" \/>\r\n\r\nHis team re-focused efforts on updates to fight that downtrend while still building this new content. It helped him push the numbers back up in the subsequent year.\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/ibm-content-program-2.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"396\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-28141\" \/>\r\n\r\nThe lesson here? At big companies, existing content debt can hold back the perceived impact of your new content. Content updates have to be a big part of your strategy, even if that content wasn\u2019t something you inherited coming in. \r\n\r\nIf you want to hear more about how Bryan implemented a successful enterprise content marketing strategy, check out our full podcast with him below.\r\n\r\n<iframe height=\"200px\" width=\"100%\" frameborder=\"no\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless src=\"https:\/\/player.simplecast.com\/733f1adc-cf33-4545-8dfd-636fc30fbeca?dark=false\"><\/iframe>\r\n\r\n[podcast-cta itunes=\"https:\/\/podcasts.apple.com\/us\/podcast\/how-ibm-generated-$250m-of-lifetime-traffic-value-lttv\/id1289467174?i=1000556214168\" stitcher=\"https:\/\/www.stitcher.com\/show\/content-and-conversation-seo-tips-from-siege-media\/episode\/how-ibm-generated-250m-of-lifetime-traffic-value-lttv-202036601\" spotify=\"https:\/\/open.spotify.com\/episode\/52CuNFb413VDzoBzpo5wDP\"]\r\n\r\n<h2>Agencies May Have Extra Value<\/h2>\r\nLet\u2019s immediately state that we\u2019re biased, as this article is being written by an agency. That said, it\u2019s still definitely the case that there\u2019s a reason why agencies tend to get used even more often by bigger companies.\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n     <li>Many public companies are held to revenue per employee metrics which makes hiring agencies attractive, given that increasing internal headcount is difficult.<\/li>\r\n     <li>The larger a company gets the more meetings tend to happen, making getting things done difficult. Often, outsourcing helps break this trend.<\/li>\r\n     <li>Large companies have established internal DNA. Finding experts in a new area is often easier than building a new muscle at a mature stage.<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n\r\nIf you decide to go this route, we suggest appointing a dedicated person to own the agency relationship, who also has time carved out to make the relationship productive. \r\n\r\nWe\u2019ve seen large companies go with feedback by committee, and this further breaks down productivity and ownership in most instances.\r\n\r\n<h2>Death Star Strategy<\/h2>\r\n\r\nThe goal of enterprise content marketing is to be the equivalent of a Death Star in your industry. It\u2019s hard to get moving, but when you finally figure things out your organic traffic graphs often look like this.\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/death-star-strategy-graph-siege-media.gif\" alt=\"\" width=\"1920\" height=\"1080\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-28159\" \/>\r\n\r\nNeed help unlocking your strategy?

Start With Audience Research<\/h2>\r\nWhile starting with keyword research can quantify a good keyword, audience research qualifies it.\r\n\r\n[embed]https:\/\/twitter.com\/RossHudgens\/status\/1465926865927999489[\/embed]\r\n\r\nIn order to market to your target audience, you need to understand their wants, needs and desires. Here are some questions to get that process started:\r\n<ul>\r\n \t<li>What age group is your audience?<\/li>\r\n \t<li>What is their income bracket?<\/li>\r\n \t<li>What do they like to do in their free time?<\/li>\r\n \t<li>Where are they in their career and where do they want to be?<\/li>\r\n \t<li>What do they love?<\/li>\r\n \t<li>What do they hate?<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n<img class=\"alignnone wp-image-28027 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/audience-research-question-checklist.png\" alt=\"find your target audience by thinking about their wants, needs, and desires. \" width=\"1401\" height=\"966\" \/>\r\n\r\nAudience research starts with customer journey mapping or putting yourself in the shoes of your customers to see your business the way they do.\r\n\r\nAlthough a keyword can quantitatively feel like a good fit, the target audience might not line up with your keyword \u2014 meaning that you likely wouldn\u2019t see a great ROI.\r\n\r\nLet\u2019s put it into practice: Say you\u2019re a startup company that helps young adults build their credit.\r\n\r\nYou\u2019re looking to establish authority in the finance space and find the keyword \u201cmutual fund vs. ETF.\u201d Although it may seem like a good match, the audience doesn\u2019t match up to your brand.\r\n\r\nPeople searching for mutual funds and ETFs are likely further into their career, have more disposable income and are looking into investment options.\r\n\r\nInstead, start by mapping your customer journey. Put yourself in the shoes of a fresh-out-of-college 20-something, just starting figuring out their financial situation. What do people around this age like to do? What are their habits?\r\n\r\nWe picture a tech-savvy worker who, in typical Zillennial fashion, avoids talking on the phone or going in-store at all costs.\r\n\r\nThen, we step back to look at keywords surrounding online payments and credit scores. We find the term \u201conline payment methods.\u201d\r\n\r\nNext, we bring this back to our brand offering of helping young people build their credit, and ultimately uncover the keyword \u201cDoes PayPal credit affect credit score?\u201d\r\n\r\nThis checks all the audience research boxes:\r\n<ul>\r\n \t<li>Closely aligns with audience intent<\/li>\r\n \t<li>Makes sense from a brand perspective<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\nIt\u2019s worth noting that keyword research isn\u2019t always this neat. No matter your industry, start by putting your audience at the forefront to find terms that convert.\r\n<h2>2. Find Your Keyword<\/h2>\r\nAlthough SEO-friendly content prioritizes the user, picking the right keyword is essential to <a href=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/creation\/what-makes-good-blog-post\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">build a winning blog post<\/a>.\r\n\r\nHere are some of our favorite tools for keyword research:\r\n<ul>\r\n \t<li><strong><a href=\"https:\/\/ahrefs.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Ahrefs<\/a>:<\/strong> This is a one-stop shop for all types of keyword research. However, Ahrefs does require a paid subscription.<\/li>\r\n \t<li><strong><a href=\"https:\/\/ads.google.com\/nav\/selectaccount?authuser=0&amp;dst=\/aw\/keywordplanner\/home&amp;pli=1\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Google Keyword Planner<\/a>:<\/strong> Google\u2019s free alternative to Ahrefs.<\/li>\r\n \t<li><strong><a href=\"http:\/\/pinterest.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Pinterest<\/a>:<\/strong> This is best for lifestyle markets like beauty, home and <a href=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/strategy\/ecommerce-content-marketing\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">e-commerce sites<\/a>.<\/li>\r\n \t<li><strong><a href=\"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Reddit<\/a>:<\/strong> Beyond industry-specific subreddits, we recommend checking out<a href=\"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/dataisbeautiful\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"> r\/dataisbeautiful<\/a>, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/infographics\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">r\/infographics<\/a> and <a href=\"http:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/coolguides\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">r\/coolguides<\/a>.<\/li>\r\n \t<li><strong><a href=\"https:\/\/trends.google.com\/trends\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Google Trends<\/a>:<\/strong> Great tool for finding relevant topics that peak during certain months of the year.<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\nAlthough keyword research tools are extremely valuable for finding high-impact keywords, it\u2019s important to treat them as indicators of general trajectory rather than the end-all-be-all of your metrics.\r\n\r\nThese tools estimate the search volume (how many searches per month) and keyword difficulty (how hard that term is to rank for, out of 100) to give you a general idea of how feasible a keyword is.\r\n\r\nA great way to find keywords is to start with your core offering and work backward. It\u2019s important to understand where your customers' journey and product intersect.\r\n\r\nAre you an enterprise SaaS company that helps with data integration? Or an e-commerce site that sells perishable goods?\r\n\r\nLet\u2019s dive into that e-commerce example.\r\n\r\nSay one of your product offerings is flowers. A search in a keyword research tool will show us that this has a search volume of 1.2 million users per month and keyword difficulty of 93 out of 100.\r\n\r\nIn <a href=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/seo\/seo-writing\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">SEO writing<\/a>, these higher numbers aren\u2019t always better. Although there\u2019s a high search volume, a startup brand would have a hard time ranking for a term with a keyword difficulty of 93.\r\n\r\nAlthough there are no hard-and-fast rules about what numbers to go after, you can base your general strategy on your domain rating (i.e., how authoritative your website is on a scale of 0 to 100).\r\n\r\nKeep in mind that these numbers are largely industry-dependent, and business-leaning industries will likely be more competitive.\r\n\r\n<strong>40 or less Domain Rating (DR): Startups or small businesses<\/strong>\r\n<ul>\r\n \t<li>Go after low keyword difficulties of 30\u201335 or less<\/li>\r\n \t<li>Consider <a href=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/services\/link-building\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">manual link building<\/a> to accelerate ranking<\/li>\r\n \t<li>Supplement with passive link-driven content like \u201cwhat is X\u201d or \u201c X statistics\u201d<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n<strong>40\u201350 DR: Mid-size businesses<\/strong>\r\n<ul>\r\n \t<li>Go after keyword difficulties of up to 40\u201350<\/li>\r\n \t<li>Consider manual link building to accelerate ranking<\/li>\r\n \t<li>Supplement with passive link-driven content like \u201cwhat is X\u201d or \u201c X statistics\u201d<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n\r\n<strong>50+ DR: Enterprise businesses<\/strong>\r\n<ul>\r\n \t<li>Go after medium keyword difficulties of up to 50+, keeping topical relevance in mind. The higher your DR, the less of a cap on keyword difficulty.<\/li>\r\n \t<li>Rely primarily on passive link-driven content for your link building strategy<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\nLuckily, there are some SEO tricks to uncover easier keywords with lower search volume. These tips will help you find keywords that are much easier to rank for:\r\n<ul>\r\n \t<li><strong>Check the People Also Ask (PAA) box.<\/strong> This is a search engine results page (SERP) feature that shows questions related to your query. From this, we can see the term \u201cwhat is the most popular flower,\u201d which has a much more manageable KD of 23.<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n<img class=\"alignnone wp-image-28028 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/people-also-ask-box.png\" alt=\"People Also Ask result for &quot;what is the most popular flower.&quot;\" width=\"1401\" height=\"631\" \/>\r\n<ul>\r\n \t<li><strong>Use Google autocomplete.<\/strong> Type your target keyword into the Google search bar and see what suggestions come up. These are typically long-tail terms that other people have searched.<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n<img class=\"alignnone wp-image-28029 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/google-autocomplete.png\" alt=\"Google autocomplete for &quot;flowers of the world.&quot;\" width=\"1401\" height=\"862\" \/>\r\n<ul>\r\n \t<li><strong>Check related searches.<\/strong> These typically appear at the bottom of the SERP and, similar to autocomplete, show related topics people have searched.<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n<img class=\"alignnone wp-image-28030 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/related-searches.png\" alt=\"Related searches for &quot;flowers names.&quot;\" width=\"1401\" height=\"590\" \/>\r\n<ul>\r\n \t<li><strong>Look at the competition in a keyword research tool.<\/strong> What pages of theirs are bringing in the most traffic or conversions? Can you create something better?<\/li>\r\n \t<li><strong>Use Answer the Public.<\/strong> Type your parent keyword into <a href=\"https:\/\/answerthepublic.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Answer the Public<\/a> to find tons of related questions. Then, cross-reference with the keyword difficulties above to see which are feasible for your current DR.<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\nChoosing your keyword is far more qualitative than it seems. It\u2019s relatively simple to look at a few keywords and find the one with the highest search volume and lowest keyword difficulty.\r\n\r\nBut what initially seems like a great fit may not be as perfect as you initially thought. That\u2019s why audience research is so important.\r\n<h2>3. Evaluate Search Intent<\/h2>\r\nAlthough some keywords may look like a good fit, the SERP might be pulling up products, local recommendations or other features that indicate your blog post might not be the right fit.\r\n\r\nSearch intent is the purpose of a user\u2019s search. Are they trying to buy a product? Land on a specific website? Find a local sandwich shop?\r\n\r\nIn order to rank for your keyword, you need to make sure your post matches the search intent.\r\n\r\nWhile a keyword like \u201chow to build a desk\u201d has a clear ordered list structure, the SERP for \u201c<a href=\"https:\/\/www.google.com\/search?q=how+to+make+a+sandwich&amp;ei=z6UzYt_8IPPQkPIPjJyNmAQ&amp;ved=0ahUKEwifoMimic72AhVzKEQIHQxOA0MQ4dUDCA4&amp;uact=5&amp;oq=how+to+make+a+sandwich&amp;gs_lcp=Cgdnd3Mtd2l6EAMyBQgAEIAEMgUIABCABDIFCAAQgAQyBQgAEIAEMgUIABCABDIFCAAQgAQyBQgAEIAEMgUIABCABDIFCAAQgAQyBQgAEIAEOgcILhDUAhBDOgUIABCRAjoNCC4QsQMQxwEQowIQQzoOCC4QgAQQsQMQxwEQowI6CwguEIAEEMcBENEDOggIABCxAxCDAToLCC4QgAQQxwEQowI6CwgAEIAEELEDEIMBOgUILhCABDoECAAQQzoECC4QQzoHCC4QsQMQQzoLCC4QgAQQxwEQrwE6BwguEIAEEAo6CAgAEIAEELEDOggILhCABBCxAzoKCAAQsQMQgwEQQ0oECEEYAEoECEYYAFAAWNOTAWCYlQFoBXABeACAAYgBiAGiEpIBBDE5LjaYAQCgAQGwAQDAAQE&amp;sclient=gws-wiz\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">how to make a sandwich<\/a>\u201d is more of a mixed bag.\r\n\r\n<img class=\"alignnone wp-image-28031 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/search-intent-funnel-stage.png\" alt=\"top funnel stages have informational search intent, while lower funnel stages have commercial, transactional, or navigational search intent. \" width=\"1401\" height=\"1029\" \/>\r\n\r\nIn general, there are four types of search intent: informational, commercial, transactional and navigational.\r\n<h3>Informational Intent<\/h3>\r\nInformational intent helps users learn more about a topic. It looks at related keywords, commonly asked questions and similar topics to pull the most helpful information first. Informational intent is typically more top funnel.\r\n\r\nTake the query \u201c<a href=\"https:\/\/www.google.com\/search?q=what+is+a+shacket&amp;oq=what+is+a+shacket&amp;aqs=chrome..69i57j0i512l6j0i22i30l3.32965j0j7&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8#bsht=CgRmYnNtEgIIBA\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">what is a shacket<\/a>.\u201d Informational intent queries answer this question and provide context on terms that users might be searching surrounding this topic, like \u201chow to wear a shacket\u201d or \u201cshacket styling tips.\u201d\r\n\r\n<strong>Examples:<\/strong>\r\n<ul>\r\n \t<li>What is a shacket<\/li>\r\n \t<li>How to wear a shacket<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n<h3>Commercial Intent<\/h3>\r\nCommercial queries often compare or rank products, providing specific information to help users get closer to making the purchase. Commercial intent is typically more mid to bottom funnel.\r\n\r\n<strong>Examples:<\/strong>\r\n<ul>\r\n \t<li>Shacket vs. jacket<\/li>\r\n \t<li>Best shackets 2022<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n<h3>Transactional Intent<\/h3>\r\nTransactional intent is meant to help the user make a purchase. These are often more bottom funnel queries. Transactional queries aren\u2019t as common when writing content for blogs or resource hubs.\r\n\r\n<strong>Examples:<\/strong>\r\n<ul>\r\n \t<li>Shackets near me<\/li>\r\n \t<li>Where to buy a shacket<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n<h3>Navigational Intent<\/h3>\r\nNavigational intent helps users get to a specific destination.\r\n\r\nNavigational intent is often branded (e.g., Nordstrom shackets), which is part of why building your brand name and recognition is crucial in SEO. These tend to be bottom funnel queries with high intent to purchase.\r\n\r\n<strong>Examples:<\/strong>\r\n<ul>\r\n \t<li>Nordstrom shackets<\/li>\r\n \t<li>Burlington Coat Factory shackets<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\nOnce you\u2019ve determined that your keyword is a good fit for your search intent, you can start building your SEO foundation.

Write Your Title<\/h2>\r\nThe title is your chance to make a good first impression.\r\n\r\nPost titles might seem intuitive. But some small differences make a big impact on CTR, bounce rate and overall user satisfaction.\r\n\r\nHere are some guidelines to write a best-in-class article title:\r\n\r\n<img class=\"alignnone wp-image-28032 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/article-title-guidelines.png\" alt=\"Write your article title with modifiers, using your target keyword, evoking emotions, and with brackets. \" width=\"1401\" height=\"776\" \/>\r\n<ul>\r\n \t<li><strong>Use modifiers.<\/strong> Is your post cheaper, faster or newer than the competition? Can we add adjectives like free, fast, quick or best to our post?<\/li>\r\n \t<li><strong>Put the keyword as close to the front as possible.<\/strong> This isn\u2019t a hard and fast rule, but ideally, you want to get it as close as makes sense.<\/li>\r\n \t<li><strong>Add brackets.<\/strong> <a href=\"https:\/\/cdn2.hubspot.net\/hub\/53\/file-2505556912-pdf\/Data_Driven_Strategies_For_Writing_Effective_Titles_and_Headlines.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Hubspot<\/a> found that brackets in headlines can increase clicks by up to 40 percent.<\/li>\r\n \t<li><strong>Evoke an emotion.<\/strong> <a href=\"https:\/\/backlinko.com\/google-ctr-stats\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Backlinko<\/a> found that titles with positive or negative sentiment improved CTR by up to 7 percent.<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\nIdeally, your title should take industry and vertical nuances into account. Here are some examples:\r\n\r\n<img class=\"alignnone wp-image-28033 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/industry-and-vertical-nuances.png\" alt=\"Use title best practices to create an engaging article title. \" width=\"1401\" height=\"1706\" \/>\r\n\r\nOnce you\u2019ve crafted your click-worthy title, you can move on to building your SEO architecture.\r\n<h2>5. Choose Your Title Tag<\/h2>\r\nA <a href=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/seo\/title-tags\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">title tag<\/a> is the title you see appear in search results. These differ from article titles, which is what you see when you land on a page.\r\n\r\nA high-impact title tag should make an entrance, draw attention and keep users engaged.\r\n\r\nCompared to titles, title tags often include the brand name. This is a key way to differentiate yourself on the SERP and use your brand authority to drive visits.\r\n\r\n<img class=\"alignnone wp-image-28034 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/title-vs-title-tag.png\" alt=\"Title tag is on the SERP, title is on your website. \" width=\"1400\" height=\"764\" \/>\r\n\r\nTitle tags are a significant ranking factor for Google. They\u2019re made of crawlable HTML code that helps Google determine the big-picture topic of your article \u2014 hence the importance of including your primary keyword.\r\n\r\nIn a perfect world, the title tag formula is simple:\r\n\r\n<em><strong>Primary Keyword, Hook - Brand Name<\/strong><\/em>\r\n\r\nBut SEO writing doesn\u2019t exist in a vacuum. Here are some real-world ways to optimize your title tag for SEO:\r\n<ul>\r\n \t<li><strong>Keep the length under 60 characters.<\/strong> We recommend using a <a href=\"https:\/\/moz.com\/learn\/seo\/title-tag\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">title tag checker<\/a>.<\/li>\r\n \t<li><strong>Be a 95 percent match for your title.<\/strong> Make a few small changes if needed, but you want to send a clear, aligned message to Google.<\/li>\r\n \t<li><strong>Use hyphens, not pipes.<\/strong> A recent <a href=\"https:\/\/www.semrush.com\/blog\/case-study-should-you-add-pipes-or-dashes-to-your-title-ag-\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">SEMrush<\/a> study found that switching pipes (|) to dashes (-) resulted in a 9 percent increase in CTR \u2014 no small number for about a second of work.<\/li>\r\n \t<li><strong>Ask a question.<\/strong> <a href=\"https:\/\/backlinko.com\/google-ctr-stats\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Backlinko<\/a> found that title tags containing a question have a 14.1 percent higher CTR.<\/li>\r\n \t<li><strong>Don\u2019t keyword stuff.<\/strong> While \u201cWedding Advice Spring Wedding Marriage\u201d may hit several keywords, it also sets off alarm bells to the user (and Google).<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\nWhile the above is important to optimize for Google, you also want to optimize for uses. Learn about the B.R.A.V.E framework for writing title tags that rank in the video below.\r\n<div class=\"video-container\"><iframe title=\"YouTube video player\" src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/LBYIkwsUts0\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"><\/iframe><\/div>\r\nA high-impact title tag should make an entrance, draw attention and keep users engaged.\r\n<h2>6. Optimize Your URL<\/h2>\r\nAn optimal <a href=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/seo\/how-to-create-the-best-url-structures\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">URL structure<\/a> gives context to your page, so both your readers and Google understand what you\u2019re writing about. It helps you build a clear information hierarchy across your site.\r\n\r\nRule of thumb, the simpler your URL the better.\r\n\r\nYour URL should contain your target keyword (sans stop words like a, and, the and of) and in a perfect world, little else.\r\n\r\nIn addition to providing context about the topic of your post, URLs that contain a keyword are shown to have a <a href=\"https:\/\/backlinko.com\/google-ctr-stats\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">45 percent<\/a> higher click-through rate (CTR) than those that don\u2019t.\r\n\r\nSo if you\u2019re writing an article on how to build a sandcastle, your URL should follow a structure along the lines of \/how-to-build-sandcastle\/.\r\n\r\nHere are some additional best practices for SEO-friendly URLs.\r\n<ul>\r\n \t<li><strong>Write your URL for the user.<\/strong> Shorter, contextual URLs are more helpful for readers and help inspire trust. Google crawls these URLs and has shown a preference for short, explanatory URLs.<\/li>\r\n \t<li><strong>Use subfolders to avoid over-optimization.<\/strong> Subfolders provide context on the information hierarchy of your post. A URL subfolder of \/kids\/how-to-build-sandcastle\/ helps Google understand that you\u2019re a family-friendly website, without lengthening your URL slug.<\/li>\r\n \t<li><strong>Make your URL exactly the keyword, and nothing else.<\/strong> Don\u2019t add adjectives or qualifiers that could dilute your target keyword. A URL of \/how-to-build-sandcastle\/ will perform better than \/how-to-build-sandcastle-fast\/.<\/li>\r\n \t<li><strong>Use-hyphens, instead_of_underscores.<\/strong> Hyphens function as a space between the words, further helping Google contextualize keywords. Without hyphens, Google would be looking at the keyword \u201chowtobuildasandcastle,\u201d rather than \u201chow to <strong>build a sandcastle.\u201d<\/strong><\/li>\r\n \t<li><strong>Remove stop-words.<\/strong> Filler words like \u201ca,\u201d \u201cand\u201d or \u201cthe\u201d are unnecessary, so long as the intent of your piece is unchanged.<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n<h2>7. Write Your Meta Description<\/h2>\r\nMeta descriptions are the blurb users see under your title tag in the SERP. Think of a meta description as an elevator pitch for your article, getting your key points across and drawing the user in less time than it takes to tie your shoe.\r\n\r\nAlthough Google will sometimes generate their own meta, they recommend you <a href=\"https:\/\/www.seroundtable.com\/google-says-fill-in-your-meta-descriptions-26599.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">write your own<\/a>.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, if you don\u2019t include a meta description, Google will create its own or sometimes even override yours with text that they feel best serves the reader.\r\n\r\nMeta descriptions give you another opportunity to <a href=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/creation\/content-creation\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">create SEO-friendly content<\/a> by following best practices:\r\n<ul>\r\n \t<li><strong>Include your target keyword, ideally as early as possible.<\/strong> This passes along the strongest signal of intent to Google.<\/li>\r\n \t<li><strong>Keep the length between 120\u2013156 characters.<\/strong> Meta descriptions may be truncated, so try to convey your key points within the first 120 characters.<\/li>\r\n \t<li><strong>Include a CTA.<\/strong> Invite your users to take action. <em>Learn more, try now, find out.<\/em><\/li>\r\n \t<li><strong>Ensure your meta accurately describes your page.<\/strong> Lean into your headers and post structure to convey your topic.<\/li>\r\n \t<li><strong>Look at what\u2019s ranking on the SERP.<\/strong> Are the top few posts showing their own meta, or did Google create one themselves? As a general rule, try to mirror what Google is showing.<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n<h2>8. Build Your Content Structure<\/h2>\r\nSEO-friendly content starts with a solid foundation.\r\n\r\nIf creating a blog post is like making a sandwich, choosing your content structure is deciding between a panini, sub or hot dog (if you\u2019d consider that a sandwich).\r\n\r\nYour content structure is almost always inherent in your keyword.\r\n\r\nSearching your target query in Google and seeing what formats are ranking is a good indicator of which structure you should choose.\r\n\r\nGood <a href=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/seo\/post-structure-for-seo\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">post structure<\/a> is written to be simple for users (and Google) to easily understand target keywords, key takeaways and unique value adds.\r\n<div class=\"video-container\"><iframe title=\"YouTube video player\" src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/Lh2ryMqrPtk\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"><\/iframe><\/div>\r\nIn general, your post structure relies on headings like H1, H2 and H3 to understand what you\u2019re writing about. You want to build these headings around keywords \u2014 SEMrush found that <a href=\"https:\/\/www.semrush.com\/blog\/anatomy-of-top-performing-articles\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">36 percent<\/a> of articles using H2 and H3 tags had better traffic, share and backlink performance.While each situation is unique, an H2 can often be made of:\r\n<ul>\r\n \t<li>Long-tail keywords<\/li>\r\n \t<li>People also ask queries<\/li>\r\n \t<li>Direct answers to your target keyword<\/li>\r\n \t<li>Information gaps<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\nThis isn\u2019t a hard and fast rule. In fact, part of SEO-savviness is knowing when to break it. Ask yourself, \u201chow can we not only match the SERP but outcompete it?\u201d\r\n\r\nIn general, <strong>simpler structures are usually better.<\/strong> You want to answer the user query as simply and quickly as possible.\r\n\r\nLet\u2019s look at some examples with the keyword \u201chow to cook rice.\u201d\r\n<h3>Bad Post Structure<\/h3>\r\n<img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-28035\" src=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/bad-post-structure.png\" alt=\"Bad post structure is overcomplicated and muddles the key takeaways.\" width=\"1401\" height=\"800\" \/>\r\n\r\nJust like cooked rice, this post structure is fluffy (but unlike cooked rice, it\u2019s not in a good way). Users have to skim for the actual steps, and Google has a hard time determining what\u2019s most important.\r\n\r\nNow, let\u2019s look at a strong example of post structure.\r\n<h3>Good Post Structure<\/h3>\r\n<img class=\"alignnone wp-image-28036 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/good-post-structure.png\" alt=\"Good post structure is simple and to the point.\" width=\"1401\" height=\"553\" \/>\r\n\r\nThis example cuts the fat and gets to the steps immediately, meaning the reader doesn\u2019t need to do as much heavy lifting and Google gets a clear signal of intent.\r\n\r\nUse what\u2019s ranking and the quick answer box as an indicator of what your post structure should look like.\r\n<h2>9. Start Your Research and Writing<\/h2>\r\nA strong post structure sets you up for success, but well-constructed, thoughtful research makes your content a home run.\r\n\r\nHere are some of our favorite tips for more effective writing:\r\n<ul>\r\n \t<li><strong>Put your readers first by writing with empathy.<\/strong> Put yourself in their shoes to understand what they want to see and how you can convey it. How advanced is their knowledge of your topic? Do they want a brief overview or an in-depth guide?<\/li>\r\n \t<li><strong>Keep your readers entertained.<\/strong> Ask yourself if you\u2019d want to read the content that you wrote. While you don\u2019t need to infuse a serious topic with jokes, it\u2019s important to keep your energy up and infuse your writing with personality.<\/li>\r\n \t<li><strong>Build trust with your readers.<\/strong> Make sure your claims can be backed up with proof and your writing is polished and easy to understand.<\/li>\r\n \t<li><strong>Make sure your post adds value.<\/strong> Remove filler sentences, break your copy into chunks and make it easy to digest.<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\nLearn more about our favorite writing tips in practice below.\r\n<h3>Write With Empathy<\/h3>\r\nWhether you\u2019re managing a team, writing an article or helping your grandparents learn how to use an iPhone, empathy can be your superpower.\r\n\r\n<img class=\"alignnone wp-image-28037 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/write-with-empathy-rand-fishkin.png\" alt=\"Great writers have immense empathy for their audience. \" width=\"1401\" height=\"937\" \/>\r\n\r\nWriting with empathy helps you build organic trust by tapping into (and acknowledging) your reader\u2019s emotions.\r\n\r\nIt means solving a problem, not just a query. By putting yourself in the shoes of the reader, you\u2019re able to think about their needs, wants and desires. What else do they care about?\r\n\r\nWriting with empathy means embracing intellectual humility. Regardless of how qualified you are, or what you think is the right answer, your job is to help your reader \u2014 not to help yourself.\r\n\r\nHere are some phrases to keep empathy in mind while writing:\r\n<ul>\r\n \t<li>Be informative, not pious<\/li>\r\n \t<li>Be helpful, not trivializing<\/li>\r\n \t<li>Be compassionate, not condescending<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\nShowing empathy with your writing is a work in progress for the SEO industry as a whole. It requires patience and thrives on collaboration.\r\n\r\nWhat\u2019s most important is to make an active effort to be inclusionary, intentional and understanding with your words.\r\n<h3>Keep Readers Entertained<\/h3>\r\nOne of our favorite ways to write engaging <a href=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/creation\/how-to-write-a-blog-post\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">blog posts<\/a> is with a few proven acronyms (can you tell we love these yet?). Here are some of our best tricks to make your research stand out.\r\n<h4>Create Out-of-the-Box Content With V.I.N.E.S<\/h4>\r\n<img class=\"alignnone wp-image-28038 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/keep-readers-entertained-vines-acronym.png\" alt=\"Make creative content by looking to video, images, news, experts, and social for inspiration.\" width=\"1401\" height=\"422\" \/>\r\n\r\nV.I.N.E.S. is an acronym for more out-of-the-box research methods. These are particularly useful for not only matching but outcompeting the SERP:\r\n<ul>\r\n \t<li><strong>Video:<\/strong> Look up your keyword on YouTube to find gaps in search intent. What are people on YouTube talking about that isn\u2019t mentioned in articles? Can you look at the comment section to uncover new questions?<\/li>\r\n \t<li><strong>Images:<\/strong> Check the \u201cimages\u201d tab in Google. Are the images illustrative or decorative? Do they help visualize a concept?<\/li>\r\n \t<li><strong>News:<\/strong> Look at the \u201cnews\u201d tab in Google. Are there any surveys or data studies you can use? Is this a trending topic?<\/li>\r\n \t<li><strong>Experts:<\/strong> Follow industry experts on social media, read industry blogs or subscribe to newsletters for thought leadership. Note that this is most valuable in B2B or business industries.<\/li>\r\n \t<li><strong>Social:<\/strong> Search your keyword on Reddit, Pinterest, Etsy or Twitter to see what\u2019s fulfilling the user's search intent. Note that this is most valuable in B2C or lifestyle industries.<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n<h4>Pique Interest with P.P.B.<\/h4>\r\nP.P.B. stands for Preview, Proof, Benefit. With P.P.B., you use your lead sentence as a hook to complement your headline.\r\n\r\nWe use this to reduce bounce rates and <a href=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/creation\/blog-introductions\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">engage readers with our intro<\/a>.\r\n\r\n<div class=\"video-container\"><iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/IgIzR2Z21nI\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen><\/iframe><\/div>\r\n\r\nYour introduction should <strong>preview<\/strong> what\u2019s to come, show <strong>proof<\/strong> of why readers should listen and clearly explain the <strong>benefit<\/strong> of reading your post.\r\n\r\nP.P.B. can come in any order or it can even be combined.\r\n\r\n<img class=\"alignnone wp-image-28039 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/preview-proof-benefit.png\" alt=\"Preview what's to come, prove why you should talk about it, explain the benefits. \" width=\"1401\" height=\"811\" \/>\r\n<ul>\r\n \t<li><strong>Preview:<\/strong> Divulge what\u2019s to come in the rest of the article.

Are they knowledgeable enough to write about this topic? If not, did they do their due diligence and source facts from official sources like journal articles and industry experts?<\/li>\r\n \t<li><strong>Authoritativeness:<\/strong> Similar to expertise, authority refers to the blog post author. But it also refers to the blog post content, and the website the blog is hosted on. <a href=\"https:\/\/helpareporter.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Help a Reporter<\/a> is a great resource to source original expert quotes for topics that you need to establish authoritativeness on. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.searchenginejournal.com\/study-shows-outgoing-links-have-positive-effects-on-seo\/157431\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">External linking<\/a> is also a great way to establish authority.<\/li>\r\n \t<li><strong>Trustworthiness:<\/strong> This means that readers can rely on your duty of care to provide accurate, honest information.<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n<h3>Make Your Writing Digestible<\/h3>\r\nSo, you finished your first draft. After celebrating, stretching and clearing the five empty coffee cups on your desk, it\u2019s time to start editing.\r\n\r\nYou\u2019ve likely looked back on your work before and seen the dreaded wall of text. It could be the most beautiful, eloquent writing in the world \u2014 but you know that it needs to be broken up, or readers will skip past it.\r\n\r\nThere\u2019s no beating around the bush: bad user experience equals bad SEO.\r\n\r\nThat\u2019s why scannability is so important. SEO-friendly content doesn\u2019t make readers do the heavy lifting. It has clear hierarchical features to emphasize the key takeaways. Here are some tricks to make your content more digestible:\r\n<ul>\r\n \t<li><strong>Use bullets and numbered lists to make copy more digestible.<\/strong> Let\u2019s be real: there\u2019s a solid chance you skimmed the intro above and jumped straight to this bullet. It\u2019s ok \u2014 we all do it. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.prweb.com\/releases\/2012\/12\/prweb10221964.htm\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Caltech neuroscience<\/a> ran a study to figure out why: users think less about preference and more about what sticks out.<\/li>\r\n \t<li><strong>Add crawlable tables to contextualize your information.<\/strong> Let\u2019s look at the SERP for \u201cwomens sizes.\u201d Google understands that you want a quick answer, so it pulled up a crawlable table to faster solve your query.<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n<img class=\"alignnone wp-image-28040 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/crawlable-tables.png\" alt=\"crawlable charts help increase the chance of rich snippets.\" width=\"1401\" height=\"1182\" \/>\r\n<ul>\r\n \t<li><strong>Compare your article length to competitors. <\/strong>Ideally, you want to match or slightly exceed what\u2019s ranking on the SERP.<\/li>\r\n \t<li><strong>Compare your lists to competitors.<\/strong> While you want to slightly exceed the competition here as well, it\u2019s worth noting that quality trumps quantity, especially in more business-leaning industries.

Give your readers a visual break by keeping paragraphs short and concise. As a general rule, one idea equals one paragraph.<\/li>\r\n \t<li><strong>Add a table of contents<\/strong>. A table of contents provides a clear preview of your article and can improve crawlability.<\/li>\r\n \t<li><strong>Add in-post text boxes.<\/strong> These create a visual callout for the reader while still allowing Google to crawl the copy.<\/li>\r\n \t<li><strong>Introduce complimentary text colors.<\/strong> Adding subtle, branded color to your subheads helps drive home your branding and creates visual callouts for the reader.<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\nWell-architected posts put scannability and post structure at the forefront.\r\n<h2>10. Build Your Internal Linking Web<\/h2>\r\nInternal links make your post findable and create a natural information hierarchy. Google has also confirmed that internal links <a href=\"https:\/\/support.google.com\/webmasters\/answer\/7451184?hl=en\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">count as a ranking factor<\/a>.\r\n\r\nHere are the main principles of building a well-optimized internal linking strategy.\r\n\r\n<img class=\"alignnone wp-image-28041 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/internal-linking-quality-relevancy-1.png\" alt=\"Use quantity and relevancy as a guide for internal linking.\" width=\"1401\" height=\"319\" \/>\r\n<h3>Quantity<\/h3>\r\nIn general, you should be aiming for at least five internal links and five outlinks on each piece of content.\r\n\r\nThis prevents orphan pages or pages that don\u2019t link to anything else on your website. Orphan pages are difficult for Google to contextualize and therefore can have a hard time ranking for their target keyword.\r\n\r\nAs you\u2019re writing your post, find five relevant pages on your site and <strong>add your new post\u2019s link within the live posts.<\/strong>\r\n\r\nThen, find five relevant blog posts on your site and <strong>add links to the live posts within your new post.<\/strong>\r\n\r\nAs an added bonus, internal linking makes users more likely to stay on your site, since they\u2019ll be clicking through to related blog posts.\r\n<h3>Relevancy<\/h3>\r\nThe pages you link to matter. Google crawls your site through these internal links, so you need to make sure your links are topically related.\r\n\r\nLet\u2019s revisit our sandcastle example from earlier. If you\u2019re writing about how to build a sandcastle, you\u2019ll want to link to posts around similar topics, such as:\r\n<ul>\r\n \t<li>What to do at the beach<\/li>\r\n \t<li>What to bring to the beach<\/li>\r\n \t<li>Summertime kids activities<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\nAll of these topics are tangentially related to your post and will help Google contextualize the topic of your article.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, you want the actual anchor text used to be topically relevant. Good anchor text helps Google contextualize the page you\u2019re linking out to.\r\n\r\nSay your sandcastle blog post talks about different tools you can use to level up your castle: shovels, buckets or even a paint scraper. This would be a natural location for you to link to a post on what to bring to the beach.\r\n\r\n<img class=\"alignnone wp-image-28042 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/relevant-anchor-text.png\" alt=\"Relevant anchor text provides context for the reader.\" width=\"1401\" height=\"919\" \/>\r\n\r\nYour internal links should be spread out throughout your post. Too many links in one place leads to a bad user experience, and a bad user experience equals bad SEO.\r\n<h2>11. Add Visual Elements<\/h2>\r\nVisual elements help visually introduce complex topics. Whether through <a href=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/creation\/blog-post-images\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">blog post images<\/a>, checklists, templates, infographics or GIFs, visual elements are powerful tools for SEO-friendly content.\r\n\r\nVisuals can break up your content, help convey complex ideas, and even provide SEO value through metadata optimization.\r\n\r\n<div class=\"video-container\"><iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/3tMLpFuCDBo\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen><\/iframe><\/div>\r\n\r\nHere are some best practices for including visuals in your content:\r\n<ul>\r\n \t<li><strong>Use the SERP to uncover intent.<\/strong> When searching your target keyword, check out the \u201cimages\u201d tab to get an idea of what users want to see. Is it mostly illustration or photography? Are there infographics, checklists or any other shareable element?<\/li>\r\n \t<li><strong>Reduce image size.<\/strong> Image sizes are an important factor of Core Web Vitals, which are another Google ranking factor. The smaller your image size, the faster it\u2019ll load.<\/li>\r\n \t<li><strong>Optimize image names.<\/strong> Clear, descriptive image names give Google context and help build trust with the user. What would you rather download: \u201chow-to-get-rid-of-allergies.JPG\u201d or \u201cIMG306812.PNG\u201d?<\/li>\r\n \t<li><strong>Add clear, descriptive alt text.<\/strong> Alt text is important for accessibility and provides tangible SEO benefits. Readers with visual impairments can use alt text to contextualize in-post images \u2014 an example of empathy in action.<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\nCheck out more of our <a href=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/seo\/blog-best-practices-seo\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">blog design best practices for SEO<\/a>.\r\n<h2>12. Don\u2019t Forget Technical SEO<\/h2>\r\nNo matter how great the writing, SEO-friendly content isn\u2019t going to see page 1 of the SERP without a <a href=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/services\/seo\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">technically healthy site<\/a>.\r\n\r\nTechnical SEO is the \u201clegwork\u201d you need to do to ensure your website meets technical requirements for search engines. It helps search engines crawl your website more efficiently, ultimately boosting your rankings on the SERP.\r\n\r\nYou can think of technical SEO like the stage crew at a play \u2014 keeping the show running behind the scenes while largely being invisible to the audience.\r\n\r\nHere are some examples of how technical SEO can help your site:\r\n<ul>\r\n \t<li>Improve page loading speed by optimizing Core Web Vitals<\/li>\r\n \t<li>Remove low value pages through 301 redirects<\/li>\r\n \t<li>Improve navigability by creating a flat, organized site structure<\/li>\r\n \t<li>Fix orphan pages by analyzing internal links<\/li>\r\n \t<li>Optimize international user experience with hreflang<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\nSEO-savvy websites understand the crucial role technical SEO plays in overall site health and will conduct a <a href=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/seo\/content-audit\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">technical SEO audit<\/a> every few months. These audits look at overall site health and structure, and help you make data-driven decisions to prune low-performing content and hone in on the winners.\r\n\r\nWant to see it for yourself? <a href=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/work\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Check out some of our work<\/a> to see the results of implementing these SEO-friendly content strategies.\r\n\r\nIf you want to dive deeper into the anatomy of SEO-driven content, check out our proprietary <a href=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/courses\/content-marketing\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">course on content marketing<\/a> where we divulge some of our best secrets of the trade.\r\n\r\nOr, <a href=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/business-form\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">get in touch with our team today<\/a> to learn how we can help drive results with a laser-focused SEO content strategy."

    "title": "Content Marketing for Startups: How To Make It To Scale",
    "content": "Learn how content marketing can give your startup star power.\r\n\r\nAll kinds of businesses, from startup- to enterprise-level, are increasing their marketing budgets to create content that converts. If you\u2019re eager to invest in content marketing and get your brand\u2019s name in blue lights (SERP blue, that is) but wonder if your startup is ready, this is the guide for you. \r\n\r\nSiege has developed startup strategies that <b>increase organic traffic value by $215,000+ in a year, with 85% of keyword-driven posts ranking on page 1<\/b>. We\u2019ve even helped a personal loan startup increase its backlink profile by 213% in 12 months. \r\n\r\nThat\u2019s no easy feat in the finance space.\r\n\r\nContent marketing for startups can build buzz around your brand, but your timing, project priorities, and execution have huge implications for your success. \r\n\r\nBelow are our tips for <a href=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/services\/seo\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">stellar SEO<\/a> and content marketing strategies to implement from the start. \r\n\r\n<div class=\"video-container\"><iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/qXujJpV2RBY\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen><\/iframe><\/div>\r\n\r\nChoosing the right stage to invest in your startup\u2019s content marketing is critical to seeing its full traffic potential. Startups in the seed round are still searching for their product-market fit, and limited funds make content marketing a risky investment. \r\n\r\nSmaller brands with less authority also take longer to generate SEO results. Early startups may not see growth for 12-18 months, while Series A startups have secure funding and a brand identity that can return growth in six to eight months. \r\n\r\n<img src=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/Spending-Budget-By-Startup-Stage-1.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1400\" height=\"1016\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-27904\" \/>\r\n\r\nA content marketing strategy begins with your business goals and product. Content produced without a concrete direction can dilute your brand identity within 12 months or drive less-than-relevant traffic that doesn\u2019t convert. \r\n\r\nOn the other hand, Series A startups naturally generate more buzz with <a href=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/marketing\/what-is-digital-pr\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">PR mentions<\/a> that content marketing can capitalize on within the content strategy. The increased equity can support high-quality content marketing that scales with business, so you don\u2019t have to go back to the drawing board to perfect your strategy.\r\n\r\n<h2>2. Build a Foundation for Growth<\/h2>\r\nYour content strategy begins before you put metaphorical pen to paper, and you can lay the foundation for a strategy that scales in the seed phase. Two key elements to building a foundation for growth include a well-built website and a strong brand identity with buzz.\r\n\r\nA positive user experience is major in SEO optimization, and it starts with your website\u2019s content management system (CMS). A good, user-friendly CMS prioritizes ease-of-use and the end user\u2019s experience to benefit your content marketing. \r\n\r\nOur tried-and-true client favorites include:\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n     <li><a href=\"https:\/\/wordpress.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">WordPress<\/a><\/li>\r\n     <li><a href=\"https:\/\/www.contentful.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Contentful<\/a><\/li>\r\n     <li><a href=\"https:\/\/webflow.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Webflow<\/a><\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n\r\nOnce your site is live, consider how you can <a href=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/marketing\/how-to-get-backlinks\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">generate links<\/a> and recognition from the press. A healthy backlink profile from reputable and relevant sites builds your site authority and supports your content strategy down the line. \r\n\r\nCompetitor coverage can be a goldmine when identifying prospects to contact. Reach out to startup and industry publications talking about the competition to promote your startup and initiatives.\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/top-startup-lists-example.gif\" alt=\"\" width=\"1280\" height=\"720\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-27830\" \/>\r\n\r\n<h2>3. Set Objectives, Performance Metrics<\/h2>\r\nAn effective content marketing strategy offers a range of business benefits, including brand awareness, user conversions, and trust through thought leadership. \r\n\r\nIf you\u2019re looking to increase your sales, optimizing your landing pages for SEO is a great place to start. If you want to build your reputation, thought leadership and case studies can prove you walk the walk. \r\n\r\nFirst, identify and prioritize your campaign goals before creating a content strategy. Your startup goals may include:\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n     <li>Generating relevant organic traffic<\/li>\r\n     <li>Growing your backlink profile<\/li>\r\n     <li>Driving visitor conversions <\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n\r\nTo measure your success, you\u2019ll also need to identify key performance indicators (KPIs). Tracking monthly KPIs allows you to see what strategies work and what you can refine while documenting your growth.\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/Track-Performance-In-Google-Analytics-1.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1400\" height=\"710\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-27905\" \/>\r\n\r\nDepending on your primary objectives, your KPIs may look like:\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n     <li>Improve monthly organic traffic by 15% in six months<\/li>\r\n     <li>Generate 15 links per month through manual outreach<\/li>\r\n     <li>Publish four SEO posts each month<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n\r\nRemember that content marketing is a long-term strategy, and you may not see complete results for six months or more. Your other KPIs and metrics can help indicate positive and negative signals to evaluate your strategy earlier.  \r\n\r\n<h2>4. Strategize With a KOB Analysis<h2>\r\n\r\nA <a href=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/strategy\/kob-analysis\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">keyword opposition to benefit (KOB) analysis<\/a> pulls relevant keywords and metrics, including search volume, keyword difficulty, and estimated traffic value. These will help identify the most high-value keyword opportunities for your site. \r\n\r\n<img src=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/kob-analysis-siege-media.gif\" alt=\"\" width=\"1280\" height=\"720\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-27832\" \/>\r\n\r\nThis analysis allows you to target low-difficulty keywords to quickly generate rankings and traffic value. These quick wins grow your brand and authority when you\u2019re starting out and can\u2019t quite outrank large competitors.\r\n\r\nAs a startup, you should adjust the estimated traffic value when considering that your business vertical may not directly align with search intent. Meeting users\u2019 needs is key to ranking, and your traffic value won\u2019t be as high if you can\u2019t secure the number 1 spot on the SERP. \r\n\r\nA KOB analysis is a valuable tool to help you rank, and we want to keep it simple. Feel free to download our KOB analysis spreadsheet below and customize it for your startup.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/05\/KOB-Keyword-Research.xlsx\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-27689\" src=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/11\/02-download-our-kob-cta.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1400\" height=\"550\" \/><\/a>\r\n\r\nWe believe every content strategy should begin with a KOB analysis. All it takes is 20-40 hours to kickstart your strategy. Get started with our video guide below.\r\n\r\n<div class=\"video-container\"><iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/bZe771lsU6c\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen><\/iframe><\/div>\r\n\r\n<h2>5. Create High-Quality, Unique Content<\/h2>\r\n\r\nGoogle is always looking for high-quality content that provides unique insights for users. Combine your expert perspective with diverse content to create a tool to outrank competitors and prove your value to readers looking for more information. \r\n\r\nHigh-quality content should be relevant to your product or service and meet your audience's needs. If you sell homeowner\u2019s insurance, then consider that a \u201chome buying checklist\u201d post  doesn\u2019t serve a majority of your audience who already own homes. \r\n\r\nOnly explore tangential topics once you\u2019ve exhausted industry topics you have the highest authority on.\r\n\r\nGoogle and users also look for proof that they can trust you. Factors like your site design, content quality and topicsz and <a href=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/creation\/author-bio\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">author bios can indicate your expertise<\/a>, authority, and trust \u2014 popularly known as EAT.\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/author-bio-example.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1400\" height=\"912\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-27840\" \/>\r\n\r\nEAT begins with the foundation you built in step 3, but improving your authority should always be a priority. The strategies below can help you build EAT to create stronger content that ranks:\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n     <li>Diverse content formats including guides, data studies, and SEO posts<\/li>\r\n     <li>Authoritative content relevant to your expertise and vertical<\/li>\r\n     <li>Reputable authors with experience listed<\/li>\r\n     <li>Good site experience with user-first content<\/li>\r\n     <li>Easy-to-digest content design<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/EAT-Strategies-For-Quality-Content.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1400\" height=\"575\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-27797\" \/>\r\n\r\n<h2>6. Diversify Your Content Types<\/h2>\r\n\r\nSEO posts are great for driving organic traffic, while promotable content can generate backlinks. Development elements in the right application can improve user experience and help your content outshine the competition.\r\n\r\nEach content format has its strengths, and content diversity supports a well-rounded campaign and its objectives. You can learn more about the <a href=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/creation\/types-of-content-marketing\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">types of content marketing<\/a> on our blog, and check out some category examples below. \r\n\r\n<h3>SEO Content<\/h3>\r\nSEO content is optimized to rank for specific keywords and answer user questions. Once ranking, SEO posts drive organic search, traffic value, and ideally convert users. \r\n\r\nThe example below is from a startup mortgage lender that improved its sitewide monthly organic traffic by 458% in 12 months through keyword-driven content marketing. This guide to affordable new construction homes is currently ranking #1 and generates $5,200 in monthly organic traffic value.\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/SEO-Example_Homebuyer.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1400\" height=\"1736\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-27906\" \/>\r\n\r\nSo, what makes this post successful?\r\n\r\nThe answer users are looking for is right there in the first sentence, which is great for user experience and it\u2019s an easy highlight for Google to pull. Optimizing the title and intro with the keyword and quick answer also helps search engines understand the post\u2019s content and index it appropriately. \r\n\r\nOf course, there are several factors that impact affordability, which we present in the second half of the sentence to show readers what else you cover in the post and hopefully answer their next questions. \r\n\r\nSEO posts are a great starting point for content marketing when you know <a href=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/creation\/seo-content\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">how to write content that ranks<\/a>. \r\n<h3>Promotable Content<\/h3>\r\nInfographics, resource guides, and data studies are designed to share and make great promotable content. Manual promotion can generate links in the short term to help content rank and develop your backlink profile. \r\n\r\nThe key to great promotable content is to provide value to readers through interesting insights or actionable steps with clear benefits. Our guide to showing your pet some love on a budget dives into healthy pet routines with beautiful illustrations and light but informative copy. \r\n\r\nThis infographic generated 17 links through manual promotion by providing budget-friendly ideas for pet parents \u2014 a highly receptive outreach market. This post also included a survey element that appealed to mid-tier news outlets and generated coverage from pet industry publications. \r\n\r\n<img src=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/Promotable-Example_Possible-Finance.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1400\" height=\"2253\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-27799\" \/>\r\n\r\nIdeally, your posts are a hybrid of promotable and SEO content. Identifying relevant, search-driven keywords to build your shareable around provides additional context for the reader, and encourages link-building through manual or organic measures. \r\n<h3>Passive Link Opportunities<\/h3>\r\nPassive link content\u2019s goal is to rank and collect a steady stream of organic links over an extended period of time for the lowest lifetime cost per link. How-to guides, statistics posts, and interactives can be natural link builders that can become passive link opportunities when paired with a strong keyword. \r\n\r\nOur grocery budget calculator below earned 364 linking root domains (LRDs) through organic mentions, and it\u2019s currently ranking #2 on Google. \r\n\r\nSeveral of these links are from high domain rating (DR) news outlets reporting on food security and affordability relative to a U.S. bill generating buzz. Our calculator and budget recommendations were the perfect references to discuss American families' grocery bills.\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/grocery-budget-calc.gif\" alt=\"\" width=\"1280\" height=\"720\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-27909\" \/>\r\n\r\n<h2>7. Promote Your Content <\/h2>\r\nContent promotion ensures your hard work is seen and celebrated while expanding your brand\u2019s visibility and authority. Guest posts are a good way to build links to your content, which indicates your post\u2019s value for Google and benefit rankings. \r\n\r\nGuest spots on blogs, podcasts and web streams can also help position you and your brand as an authority in the space. This reaffirms your expertise and value to boost your ongoing content strategy. \r\n\r\n<img src=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/Ross_Twitter_2.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1400\" height=\"1132\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-27838\" \/>\r\n\r\nEven promoting your content through internal channels can improve visibility and performance. Internal links among your own blog content provide valuable next steps for users while helping Googlebots navigate your site.\r\n\r\nRepromoting your content through other formats such as social media posts, YouTube videos, or podcasts increases accessibility for users and greets your audience on their favorite platforms. It\u2019s also a budget-friendly way to repurpose content without overspending in the early startup stages.\r\n\r\n<h2>8. Monitor Your Content Marketing Strategy<\/h2>\r\n\r\nThe strongest content marketing strategies are flexible and regularly reevaluated. A quarterly review is a good opportunity to consider your growth and objectives. While your content may not rank in four months, you should be able to identify positive indicators in rankings or organic traffic. \r\n\r\nAs you review past projects, consider the relevancy of your content for your readers and brand. You may find the top-performing posts directly answer the reader\u2019s queries, while high-converting posts are super relevant to your vertical. \r\n\r\nTracking your KPIs and other performance metrics monthly is a helpful way to identify seasonal trends in your industry and content. You can also spot lost rankings or traffic early to adjust your content strategy as necessary. \r\n\r\n<img src=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/Revamp-Stale-Content-To-Boost-Traffic.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1400\" height=\"629\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-27907\" \/>\r\n\r\nBe sure to keep an eye on the age of your content, which is a key ranking factor for Google. Revamping existing content is an easy way to keep your rank, and we\u2019ve found that it can increase organic traffic by as much as 52%. \r\n\r\n<h2>Invest In Growth<\/h2>\r\n\r\nContent marketing for startups can provide significant benefits when you carefully build a foundation for your content strategy.

You won\u2019t run into an Amazon in this space, which has 267,000,000 pages indexed at the time of this writing.\r\n\r\nFor that reason, the technical aspects of SEO are less prominent and needle-moving. When your website is under 10,000 pages (and that\u2019s on the high side in this space), it\u2019s less common to see complex technical issues pop up.\r\n\r\nThis doesn\u2019t mean they can\u2019t happen or that you should completely ignore technical SEO. Rather, <a href=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/seo\/financial-services\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">SEO in the financial industry<\/a> tends to take on a different form. In our experience, a common SEO department for a finance firm actually looks something like this:\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/common-seo-dept-firm-roles.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1400\" height=\"887\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-27776\" \/>\r\n\r\nThis is because most of the SEO problems that exist in this space occur at the page level. This requires custom, thoughtful content and user experience work in order to win each query. Compared to a company like Amazon, which often scales out its infrastructure to thousands of pages and has to consider things like crawl budget, large-scale analysis is rarely possible on a smaller website.\r\n\r\nThe fintech firm can frequently have an SEO Manager tackle most technical problems, but from there they\u2019ll need significant effort dedicated to content and links from other people on the team, internally and externally.\r\n<h2>Link Value Is High Due to Acquisition Difficulty<\/h2>\r\nIn fintech, the <a href=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/seo\/link-building-cost\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">lifetime link value<\/a> we see is often &gt;$15,000. At a vertical level, this is the highest link value on the internet.\r\n\r\n<img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-27737\" src=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/common-lifetime-link-value-equation.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1400\" height=\"733\" \/>\r\n\r\nThis is because the financial industry is both valuable and also extremely difficult to get links in.\r\n\r\nUnlike industries like fashion or wedding, where we see a high number of organic links happening naturally, this rarely occurs in fintech due to the commercial association commonly seen among brands.\r\n\r\nAny time you ask for a link, people know your end goal is to generate money from them. For this reason, you\u2019ll get turned down more often and have to get creative and\/or have outstanding content.\r\n<h2>Advertising Might Be Required<\/h2>\r\n<img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-27713\" src=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/geico-commercial.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"498\" \/>\r\n\r\nIt feels weird to say, but just as trying to rank for terms like <b>home insurance, car insurance<\/b> and <b>life insurance<\/b> can be tricky, this is an industry where TV and digital advertising may be your barrier to entry.\r\n\r\nGiven the nature of fintech SEO, the \u201cbrand\u201d plays that could be done organically in other industries likely can\u2019t happen here. That said, those same brand plays are still important for brand recognition, which drives the few organic links that do occur, and also benefit CTR and promote trust on the search results which can drive better rankings.\r\n\r\nFor this reason, if your business is missing any kind of advertising strategy, there\u2019s a good chance your brand metrics in fintech will be near zero. And because of that, this will lead to worse SEO performance.\r\n\r\nIt\u2019s a tough pill to swallow but it\u2019s the nature of the beast in a very competitive, lucrative industry. We often recommend to clients trying to rank for two-word finance terms that they need to be all-in on a brand marketing strategy \u2014 through advertising \u2014 in order to win long-term.\r\n<h2>Leverage Startup Funding Journey to Generate Links<\/h2>\r\n<img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-27711\" src=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/andrew-gazdecki-tweet.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"600\" \/>\r\n\r\nIn these industries, link generation via the news of your funding rounds is one of the core pillars of a successful SEO strategy. NerdWallet, the most well-known fintech content site on the internet, IPOed and now benefits from the repeat news cycle coverage of their earnings releases.\r\n\r\n<blockquote class=\"definition\">As of 2021, there were over 10,000 fintech startups registered in the United States alone and over 26,000 globally. (Statista via <i>Siege Media's <a href=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/strategy\/fintech-statistics\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Fintech Statistics<\/a><\/i>)<\/blockquote>\r\n\r\nThese links are high authority, impossible to replicate and critical for link generation on the way up to competitive rankings. It\u2019s hard to imagine a fintech company trying to rank for any competitive term being able to do that via bootstrapping given how hard links are to generate.\r\n\r\nGenerate more links via this process by looking for competitors who have raised funding in adjacent markets, then search \u201craises\u201d as a term <a href=\"https:\/\/app.ahrefs.com\/v2-site-explorer\/backlinks\/subdomains?refPageUrlRules=%5B%5B%22contains%22%2C%22raises%22%5D%5D&amp;target=rippling.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">in their backlink profile<\/a>. Pitch those same publications when you raise capital to make sure you maximize your funding story.\r\n<h2>Avoid Personal Finance Bloggers<\/h2>\r\nLinks are extremely valuable and hard to get, which often means manual outreach makes sense to generate more of them. This said, don\u2019t expect personal finance bloggers to be receptive in this industry, as they more than anyone else will just ask you for money if you pitch them.\r\n\r\nFor this reason, we suggest link building strategies in associated industries that are still relevant but not personal finance focused. Some examples are:\r\n<ul>\r\n \t<li>National news<\/li>\r\n \t<li>Local news<\/li>\r\n \t<li>Passive link generation through top-funnel rankings<\/li>\r\n \t<li>Wellness, health, and special interest groups<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\nContent that resonates very often follows the <a href=\"https:\/\/heathbrothers.com\/download\/mts-made-to-stick-model.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">S.U.C.C.E.S.s. Model<\/a>. It\u2019s simple, unexpected, credible, concrete, emotional and tells stories.\r\n\r\n<img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-27716\" src=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/success-model.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1030\" height=\"250\" \/>\r\n\r\nThe good news about money is it\u2019s a very emotional topic. This ties in perfectly to creating data-driven content that aligns with your vertical, that can then be pitched to news outlets.\r\n<h2>Calculators With Low Time to Value<\/h2>\r\nGiven financial implications, calculators make sense for most fintech companies. These are often very competitive terms, but also critical parts of your website. They will be among the highest passive link earners for you, making it logical to lean into them if you do them especially well.\r\n\r\n<img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-27732\" src=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/nerdwallet-low-time-to-value-calculator.gif\" alt=\"\" width=\"1400\" height=\"788\" \/>\r\n\r\nOur macro strategy is to try to lower the time to value of these as much as possible. As you can see in the above GIF, this calculator allows the user to get to the answer almost instantly. A few ways you can do this are by pre-filling data with common user answers and guessing location via geoIP.\r\n\r\nBy minimizing the number of times the user has to input things, you\u2019ll maximize the probability of ranking well and delivering a good experience that generates links.\r\n<h2>The Benefits of \u201cWhat Is\u201d Topics With Quick Answer Area<\/h2>\r\nAnother common query type in finance is \u201cWhat is KEYWORD?\u201d Users are trying to understand complex financial challenges and will often do so through this query set.\r\n\r\nAs Google evolves, our high-level goal as SEOs is to give users their information as quickly as possible. To best do this, giving users a quick answer above the fold, often in a subheader area, is ideal.\r\n\r\n<img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-27715\" src=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/what-is-an-ira-fidelity.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"498\" \/>\r\n\r\nThis often requires a UX restructuring of your content area to allow this to occur, but it\u2019s a highly recommended strategy to accomplish long-term rankings.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, making your definition pop makes it more likely someone will reference it in their own posts \u2014 ultimately driving further passive links which are critical for success.\r\n<h2>Editorial Review for Y.M.Y.L.<\/h2>\r\nFinance is a <a href=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/seo\/ymyl\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Your Money or Your Life<\/a> industry, one where it\u2019s extra critical for users to trust the advice of the entity before putting their credit card on the line.\r\n\r\nGiven this, it\u2019s highly recommended your content be written by a financial expert, or at very least reviewed by one. You should also make the credibility of the authors and editors clearly present on your website, establishing trust above the fold as much as possible.\r\n\r\n<img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-27712\" src=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/bankrate-credibility.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"396\" \/>\r\n\r\nBankrate does a good job of this by not only offering information about an editor but also a reviewer for the post before you get into the content. These reviewers have bios that are available on hover, providing immediate trust for readers looking to learn more.\r\n<h2>UX, Content and Links = $$$<\/h2>\r\nTo sum it up, fintech SEO means investing in content quality at the page level, being resourceful and purposeful with link generation, and having a world-class product that ties it all together.\r\n\r\nFrom there, be prepared to spend years trying to rank for some of the most competitive terms. Two-word finance terms may take 4+ years to rank for, assuming you even deserve to rank on a long-term timeline.\r\n\r\nLooking for help to expedite that timeline?

We should take them as seriously as Google does when it comes to their search results.\r\n\r\nSiege Media is an SEO-focused content agency that has written tens of thousands of high-performing titles over 10+ years of work.

Consider the Five CTR Elements: B.R.A.V.E.<\/h3>\r\n<img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-27488\" src=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/02\/brand-attributes-diagram-2-1.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1400\" height=\"1190\" \/>\r\n\r\nThe above graph covers all the major elements that may make someone want to click.\r\n\r\nYou should try to include as many as are relevant to your post, in order to encourage a click and, more importantly, boost dwell time due to that element reflecting something users want.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"https:\/\/youtu.be\/LBYIkwsUts0\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">If you\u2019ve watched our video above<\/a>, you might notice this acronym is new. That\u2019s because we realized it\u2019d be valuable to help you memorize the possible elements that can drive a click via acronym.\r\n<h3>Brand<\/h3>\r\nA strong brand is always worth including in your title tag and is more likely to drive clicks \u2014 and you can\u2019t fake it. If you\u2019re in a vertical where it\u2019s unlikely brand will ever be established, this may matter a little less and be worth leaving off if you\u2019re short on title tag space.\r\n<ul>\r\n \t<li>Foam Mattresses from Casper<\/li>\r\n \t<li>Back exercises in 15 minutes a day - Mayo Clinic<\/li>\r\n \t<li>40 Best Christmas Party Theme Ideas 2022 - Oprah Daily<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n<h3>Recentness: Perceived Freshness<\/h3>\r\n<div class=\"video-container\"><iframe title=\"YouTube video player\" src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/Q9xzdYpI3eo\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"><\/iframe><\/div>\r\nShow how up-to-date you are as a reason to drive clicks.

However, be careful to not do this in situations where people would prefer a more curated list from an expert, such as SEO tools.\r\n\r\nThe most obvious situation where a large number of results would sense is when there are <a href=\"https:\/\/www.google.com\/search?pws=0&amp;q=Fall+Wedding+Ideas\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">photos on the SERP<\/a>, as people are looking for inspiration.\r\n<ul>\r\n \t<li>85 Fall Wedding Ideas for the Ultimate Autumn Event<\/li>\r\n \t<li>100 Living Room Design Ideas Design Ideas &amp; Pictures<\/li>\r\n \t<li>70+ Stunning Living Room Ideas<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n<h3>Velocity: Time to Value<\/h3>\r\nIn general, if you save the users time in some way, they\u2019ll value your content.

Could Any SEO Have Written This?<\/h2>\r\nWhether correlative or causative, we believe it\u2019s a good idea to push for writing a title that not any SEO on the planet could have written. This shows strong knowledge of the industry which may be a positive signal to users and Google (directly or indirectly) via co-citation.\r\n\r\nHere are some examples of titles that you could only write with a baseline knowledge of the industry.\r\n<ul>\r\n \t<li>What Is Solana?

Audits, Reports, Attestation &amp; Compliance<\/li>\r\n \t<li>Wealthfront vs. Betterment: Which Robo-Advisor Is Best?<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n<h2>3. Add [Brackets] When Applicable<\/h2>\r\n<img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-27489\" src=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/02\/positive-effects-on-CTR-1.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1401\" height=\"1222\" \/>\r\n\r\nHubSpot found titles with brackets had a <a href=\"https:\/\/cdn2.hubspot.net\/hub\/53\/file-2505556912-pdf\/Data_Driven_Strategies_For_Writing_Effective_Titles_and_Headlines.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">higher CTR than those without<\/a>. The correlation here is with our \u201cVelocity\u201d idea, in that brackets are features that compel readers and push them to click on your content.\r\n\r\nExamples:\r\n<ul>\r\n \t<li>[Free Template]<\/li>\r\n \t<li>[Free Printable]<\/li>\r\n \t<li>[Data Study]<\/li>\r\n \t<li>[Calculator]<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\nIt's worth noting that Zyppy <a href=\"https:\/\/zyppy.com\/seo\/google-title-rewrite-study\/\">recently published a study<\/a> showing that Google tends to rewrite bracketed posts more often than those with parenthesis, such as (Calculator). They also tend to rewrite titles with brackets more often, but it is our belief that that's correlation due to these types titles being longer on average.\r\n\r\nIf you can keep your titles short while still using brackets (or parenthesis), test it out!\r\n<h2>4. Use Odd Numbers When Applicable<\/h2>\r\nA study found odd numbered titles had <a href=\"https:\/\/contentmarketinginstitute.com\/2011\/06\/headline-click-Through-rate\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">20% higher CTR<\/a> (why not 21%)?\r\n\r\nThe belief is that these titles feel a little less robotic and packaged, which tie into our \u201ccould any SEO have written this?\u201d suggestion.\r\n\r\nThis said, it\u2019s probably worth noting odd numbers wouldn\u2019t make sense for something like a recap of the \u201c100 best places to visit in 2022\u201d or a post that needs formality to feel official. But in any other case, odd numbers might be preferenced.\r\n<ul>\r\n \t<li>27 Ridiculously Fun Wedding Ideas - Here Comes The Guide<\/li>\r\n \t<li>31 Living Room Ideas from the Homes of Top Designers<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n<h2>5. Consider SEO-Specific Details<\/h2>\r\nThe above tips are focused on users, and by focusing on users you solve for SEO. But when it comes to the technical specifics, there are a few details worth considering.\r\n<h3>Keep the Keyword Close to the Front<\/h3>\r\n<img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-27497\" src=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/02\/keyword-usage-ahrefs.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"600\" \/>\r\n\r\nThis is a well-known best practice, but we need to mention it anyway. It doesn\u2019t have to be RIGHT at the front, but ideally, the closer, the better.\r\n\r\nWrite as a human, always. Don\u2019t force a keyword to the front at the expense of quality, as that\u2019s something that will come back to bite you.\r\n<h3>Make It the Same as the Post Title<\/h3>\r\nThis is ideal for user landing page experience and optimization. As users, you want to see the same thing you clicked.\r\n<ul>\r\n \t<li>Title Tag: 20 Unique Wedding Centerpiece Ideas You'll Say \"Yes\" To | Zola<\/li>\r\n \t<li>Post Title: 20 Unique Wedding Centerpiece Ideas You'll Say \"Yes\" To<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n<h3>Use SERP Indications, Not Keywords<\/h3>\r\n<img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-27498\" src=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/02\/wedding-card-serp.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"600\" \/>\r\n\r\nIf more than 50% of the SERP shows a different keyword at the front of titles, that shows you the topic intent for the piece.\r\n\r\nGiven that, we should revisit keyword volume and anchor to that topic intent. In our example, the above keyword \u201c<a href=\"https:\/\/www.google.com\/search?pws=0&amp;q=what+to+write+in+a+wedding+card\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">what to write in a wedding card<\/a>\u201d should actually be optimized as \u201cwedding wishes.\u201d That will allow you to capture both terms.\r\n<h3>Use Hyphens, Not Pipes<\/h3>\r\n<a href=\"https:\/\/www.semrush.com\/blog\/case-study-should-you-add-pipes-or-dashes-to-your-title-ag-\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">A recent study<\/a> from Semrush showed a 9% improvement in rankings from using a hyphen over pipes. Based on that, go with the data as it makes sense for your brand. Of course, mileage may vary and you may not be able to replicate this in your vertical.\r\n<ul>\r\n \t<li><b>Good Title:<\/b> 20 Unique Wedding Centerpiece Ideas You'll Say \"Yes\" To - The Knot<\/li>\r\n \t<li><b>Bad Title:<\/b> 20 Unique Wedding Centerpiece Ideas You'll Say \"Yes\" To | The Knot<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n<h3>Use Only the Brand Name<\/h3>\r\nIn our testing, the shorter the title tag, the more \u201cfocused\u201d it tends to be for Google. So, adding extra descriptors typically dilutes meaning and can hurt rankings.\r\n\r\nThis is most often a problem on blogs, where brands can add extra descriptors without realizing it due to CMS defaults.\r\n<ul>\r\n \t<li><b>Good Ending:<\/b> - The Knot<\/li>\r\n \t<li><b>Bad Ending:<\/b> - The Knot Expert Wedding Advice<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n<h3>Keep Titles Short (Under 60 Characters)<\/h3>\r\n<img class=\"size-full wp-image-27576 aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/02\/title-length-vs-google-rewriting-blog-post.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"600\" \/>\r\n\r\nThe previously mentioned <a href=\"https:\/\/zyppy.com\/seo\/google-title-rewrite-study\/\">Zyppy study<\/a> showed that titles above 60 characters tend to get rewritten more often.\r\n\r\nThe exact number Google rewrites (or displays) can change over time, but as we mentioned above, try to keep your titles as short as possible for SERP visibility. Plus, <a href=\"https:\/\/codeascraft.com\/2016\/10\/25\/seo-title-tag-optimization\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">one study<\/a> shows that it seems to correlate with rankings.\r\n\r\nHere\u2019s <a href=\"https:\/\/moz.com\/learn\/seo\/title-tag\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">a title tag testing tool<\/a>, but for absolute accuracy, look at your search results.\r\n\r\n<img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-27469\" src=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/02\/SEO-specific-title-tag-considerations.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1201\" height=\"628\" \/>\r\n<h2>6. Add Title Tags to Rank Trackers<\/h2>\r\nAnybody can read a post on how to write better titles, but not everyone will actually internalize the information or implement it into their workflow such that it doesn\u2019t get forgotten.\r\n\r\nIn our experience, adding process structure can help you improve and move things forward across the board.\r\n\r\n<img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-27556\" src=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/02\/siege-media-rank-tracker.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1400\" height=\"476\" \/>\r\n\r\nTo do this, adding title tags next to your rank tracking information will help you better see the impact titles have on your rankings. It makes sense to see all the primary information (the keyword, URL and title tag) in one place, as that\u2019s often the first step to improving your rankings.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, this allows you to catch anything outdated pretty immediately, should your CMS not be able to auto-update the year every time the calendar turns.\r\n<h2>7. A\/B Test Your Titles<\/h2>\r\nThese are our recommended best practices, but you can\u2019t know for certain they\u2019re best for SEO unless you test them against alternatives.\r\n\r\nBecause true A\/B testing with organic results is impossible, we can\u2019t do a truly accurate test, but we can set ourselves up to learn from the changes we make by evaluating the right factors and measuring our changes against them.\r\n\r\nIn Search Console, we can track average position and CTR for our pages for a given date range in the \u201cSearch Results\u201d section in the \u201cPerformance\u201d tab, and then by clicking pages on the bottom section.\r\n\r\n<img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-27543\" src=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/02\/search-console.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"288\" \/>\r\n\r\nWhen doing a test, we should aim to look at a window of time (generally two weeks or more) that gets us at least 2,000 impressions on the search results. The higher the number, the better.\r\n\r\nEvery significant event can change our confidence in the test \u2014 from a holiday weekend to seasonality to ranking changes \u2014 so it\u2019s important to be wary of variables like that when setting up tests.\r\n\r\nWhen we change the title tags, we don\u2019t need to note the CTR and average position at the start of the test, because Google Search Console tracks that historically, and we can find the data after the fact.\r\n\r\nDepending on the scale of your tests and\/or the importance of the pages, you may want to track in a few different ways. When we\u2019ve wanted to test an important page with high traffic, it\u2019s best to use Search Console.\r\n\r\nHere, you want to take note of four variables:\r\n<ul>\r\n \t<li>Clicks<\/li>\r\n \t<li>Average Position<\/li>\r\n \t<li>Clickthrough Rate (CTR)<\/li>\r\n \t<li>Impressions<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\nWith this, you\u2019ll want to also match up similar date ranges. Not Monday to Wednesday and Thursday to Sunday \u2014 we recommend two-week ranges if your page has decent traffic. Once you push the title tag live, you may want to take note of when you first see it in the SERPs as the \u201cstarting date\u201d for the test.\r\n\r\nOnce you see it live, it\u2019s time to wait. When at least two weeks have passed, go back and record the data for your test by customizing the date ranges in Google Webmaster Tools in the same area mentioned previously. Compare it against the previous date range in a spreadsheet to determine how each field changed.\r\n\r\n<img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-27491\" src=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/02\/siege-SEO-page-titles-2-1.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1401\" height=\"512\" \/>\r\n\r\nWhen you get your numbers back, it\u2019s time to consider how confident you are that the changes benefited you. Did your rankings increase? This is possible, hypothetically, if CTR impacts ranking, and\/or your more natural title tag appeared more relevant to Google.\r\n\r\nSecond, and more obvious, did your CTR and therefore traffic go up? If CTR is up considerably and ranking dropped slightly, it doesn\u2019t matter. Relevant traffic is what matters, not an arbitrary ranking position.\r\n\r\nIf your CTR jumped considerably and average position stayed relatively flat, congrats, you\u2019ve almost certainly made a successful change. If your average position jumped solidly and so did CTR, you might not be able to confidently determine your test was successful. That\u2019s arbitrary, though \u2014 you have increased traffic regardless, so it\u2019s not worth reverting the change.\r\n\r\n<b>One very important thing to do is have a \u201c<a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Scientific_controlg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">control<\/a>\u201d relative to your test page.<\/b> We can\u2019t have a true control, but we can compare how position and CTR changed for the site in Webmaster Tools, or other pages similar to the one being tested. This can help increase confidence in our changes when we see our test page outperforms the control.\r\n<h2>Running Long-Tail Tests on Page Types<\/h2>\r\nFor pages without enough traffic to reasonably test that still have a decent amount of traffic and a similar theme \u2014 such as <a href=\"https:\/\/moz.com\/community\/users\/151694\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">profile pages on Moz<\/a> \u2014 you can group them together to get more confidence in your changes and then test the impacts on traffic in Analytics. You can do this by creating an advanced search in GA for only those pages that will identify the impact from organic traffic across your date range.\r\n\r\nYou can create an advanced search by using the | symbol between URLs used under the Site Content -&gt; All Pages section in Google Analytics. An example using two URLs is shown below.\r\n\r\n<img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-27541\" src=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/02\/google-analytics-1.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"396\" \/>\r\n\r\nOnce you\u2019ve set up the segment for just those pages, you can compare date ranges from before and after you implemented the title tag change. If the improvement is big (it should be if you do this properly), you can be confident in your change. If it\u2019s down, revert. If it\u2019s flat, probably leave as is.\r\n\r\n<img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-27542\" src=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/02\/google-analytics-2.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"440\" \/>\r\n\r\nIf you do a good test and are working against old school SEO tactics, there\u2019s a good chance you can see 20% or better CTR improvements with a good title tag change. And that\u2019s passive \u2014 we\u2019ve seen pages experience 50%+ jumps depending on the SERP and the industry.\r\n\r\nThis is the perfect kind of test for making big improvements. If you\u2019re trying to make incremental .5% increases with organic title tags, you\u2019re in the wrong line of business \u2014 there are too many moving parts to really have confidence in your changes.\r\n\r\nThat doesn\u2019t mean you shouldn\u2019t ever make changes with CTR in mind, but it\u2019s something to consider for future campaigns. You\u2019re going to see the biggest gains with the first well-run set of tests, especially if you haven\u2019t done this before.\r\n<h2>Are Titles Part of Your DNA?<\/h2>\r\nIn our experience, writing great SEO title tags is either part of your DNA or it isn\u2019t. Some people deeply care about it, and some people just see it as a checkbox in their process.\r\n\r\nTruly successful businesses treat title tags as more than just a checkbox. They spend time and effort improving them and continue to make them top of mind in their business strategy. They\u2019re such a huge ranking factor that doing otherwise is a recipe to losing in your vertical.\r\n\r\nNeed help creating remarkable title tags?

First Line, Second Line.<\/h3>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/12\/aida-model.png\" alt=\"aida model: attention, interest, desire, call to action\" width=\"1400\" height=\"1214\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-23776\" \/>\r\n\r\nWe\u2019re big believers in the <a href=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/creation\/aida-model\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Attention, Interest, Desire, Action model<\/a> here at Siege. As part of that, the goal is to write a first line that is so compelling it forces the reader to get to the second.\r\n\r\nAnd from there, a second line that\u2019s just as good as the first, that draws the reader into the third. And then the fourth, and so on and so forth (fifth) until you get to the call to action. \r\n\r\nDave Gerhardt, an amazing copywriter himself, turned us on to the idea of <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/davegerhardt\/status\/1467648900999876612\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">first line, second line<\/a>. He\u2019s someone every aspiring writer should follow.\r\n\r\n<h3>2. Compliment the Headline<\/h2>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/12\/seo-copywriting-the-definitive-guide.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"600\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-26948\" \/>\r\n\r\nIn a perfect world, your first sentence feels like a continuation of the story started by the headline. What matters most about your post that you couldn\u2019t put in the title, but is the next-biggest element that makes it credible?\r\n\r\n<h3>3. Tell a Mini-Story<\/h3>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/12\/seo-copywriting-tips-siege-media.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"600\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-26949\" \/>\r\n\r\nPeople love stories, but you don\u2019t have a lot of room to tell them.\r\n\r\nTelling a compelling story in 4-5 sentences is one great way to hook people and get them to read further.\r\n\r\n<h3>4. Restate the Keyword + Solve for Quick Answers<h3>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/12\/the-atkins-diet-healthline.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"600\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-26950\" \/>\r\n\r\nFor SEO best practice (and user experience), you should include the top keyword at least once in the intro. \r\n\r\nAvoid using it multiple times (or overusing in the article) as that may be counterproductive to ranking. Do what feels right for the user.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, if your keyword is a question with a short answer \u2013 such as \u201cWhat is the Atkins Diet?\u201d your goal is to solve for that almost immediately.\r\n\r\nOur guidance would be to go with \u201cKEYWORD is..\u201d immediately after the header that states the keyword to make it easy for robots, and users to extract meaning and find what they\u2019re looking for.\r\n\r\nIn the above example, Healthline does both, restating the keyword and solving for that keyword that is a variant for this topic.\r\n\r\n<h3>5. Lead with Data-Backed Benefits<\/h3>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/12\/what-is-intermittent-fasting-healthline.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"600\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-26951\" \/>\r\n\r\nAs an element of Proof, one way you can get around not being a PhD is referencing people and studies from people that are equivalent. \r\n\r\nHealthline does a consistently good job of this, referencing health studies and published papers that support each article.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, statistics are compelling and often function as the \u201cFirst Sentence, Second Sentence\u201d attention part of the equation if you can pull in the right data point to support moving on to the next part of your article.\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/01\/skyrocketing-data-updated.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"396\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-27059\" \/>\r\n\r\n<h2>This is the Least Important Part<\/h2>\r\n\r\nThe blog post introduction is arguably as important as the <a href=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/seo\/title-tags\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">title<\/a>, and if not it\u2019s a very close second. Many people don\u2019t spend enough time on titles, and after that, many people don\u2019t spend enough time on blog introductions.\r\n\r\nHopefully this guide was a helpful starting point for going deeper on writing more effective introductions. \r\n\r\nAnd if you decide writing introductions aren\u2019t for you, our <a href=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/services\/content-creation\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">content creation services<\/a> might be the next-best thing.\r\n\r\n[subscribe-cta bloglink1=TRUE text1=\"Subscribe to our blog\" text2=\"Subscribe via YouTube\" url2=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/channel\/UChWtFVFpJqaGd8E2zCI1HUA?sub_confirmation=1\" target2=\"_blank\"]\r\n"

    "content": "Large websites can get messy \u2014\u00a0quickly. Having a consistent URL structure is the key to your sanity as an SEO. Here\u2019s what you need to know.\r\n\r\nWebsites, no matter their sizes, need to have a consistent and clear URL structure. Not only is this a best practice for SEO purposes, but for the users\u2019 experience on your site.\r\n\r\nWhich would you prefer to read?\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/1-url-structures.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-25064\"\/>\r\n\r\n<h2>5 Key Factors for the Best URL Structures for SEO<\/h2>\r\n\r\nFor websites of all sizes, that plan to have multi-level categories or well-built-out blogs, the URL structure is important to nail down before creating any content.\r\n\r\nThis will allow you to establish your <a href=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/seo\/e-commerce#bestpractices\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">site\u2019s navigation hierarchy<\/a>, improve the user experience, and plan your content accordingly.\r\n\r\nHere are some key factors to keep in mind when deciding which structure may work best:\r\n\r\n<h3>1. Write for the User, Not for Google<\/h3>\r\nUltimately, the URL (and <a href=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/creation\/seo-friendly-content\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">SEO-friendly content<\/a> in general) should be written for humans, not bots. As seen in the example above, the shorter URL is more pleasing to the human eye.\r\n\r\nThough Google will read and interpret either of the two URLs, it is more likely to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.hostgator.com\/blog\/reasons-shorten-url-structure\/\">rank the shorter URL<\/a> over the messier one, given it meets user intent and other ranking factors like keyword targeting.\r\n\r\n<h3>2. Create a URL That Is Functional<\/h3>\r\nFunctional URLs are ones with a flexible format in which the user can simply remove part of the URL with the understanding that each subfolder must also be a standalone page that they could get back to.\r\n\r\nTheir structure would look something like:\r\n\r\n<b>https:\/\/awebsite.com\/<mark>leve1\/level2\/level3\/<\/mark><\/b>\r\n\r\n<h3>3. Reflect the Main Keywords in the URL<\/h3>\r\nIf your main navigation bar or blog categories contain keywords that you are trying to rank for, use these same keywords in the URL.\r\n\r\nFor example, a blog subcategory landing page on hair care might look like:\r\n\r\n<b>https:\/\/awebsite.com\/blog\/hair-care<\/b>\r\n\r\nThe blog post itself may look like this:\r\n\r\n<b>https:\/\/awebsite.com\/blog\/blonde-hair-care-tips<\/b>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/2-url-structures.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-25025\" width=\"1400\" height=\"802\">\r\n\r\n<h3>4. Don\u2019t Force a Short URL Structure<\/h3>\r\nIf a shortened structure simply will not work for the size of your site, it\u2019s better to have a well-organized, <a href=\"https:\/\/loganix.com\/url-structure-for-seo\/\">human-readable structure<\/a> than a messy one!\r\n\r\n<blockquote class=\"definition\">A well-organized, well-structured URL would be nothing without a well-organized, well-structured post. Take a look at our favorite strategies to optimize your blog post for SEO <a href=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/seo\/seo-writing\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">here<\/a>.<\/blockquote>\r\n\r\n<h3>5. Minimize Click Depth When Applicable<\/h3>\r\nWe know that pages farther away from the home page are deemed \u201cless important\u201d but this does not mean \u201cless rank-able.\u201d\r\n\r\nIdeally, if your main category and subcategory pages are about 3\u20134 clicks away from the homepage, this is still suitable for a large site and should not have negative SEO implications so long as the structure is consistent and clean.\r\n\r\n<h2>How To Create SEO-Friendly URLs<\/h2>\r\nNow that we understand what impacts an ideal URL structure, let's go over how to implement it.\r\n\r\n<h3>Start by Planning Your Blogs in a Subfolder<\/h3>\r\nLet\u2019s say your website plans on having a pretty well-built out blog with the categories and subcategories seen below:\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/3-url-structures.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1400\" height=\"323\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-25065\" \/>\r\n\r\nYou\u2019d start by organizing each category within a \/blog\/ subfolder like:\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/4-url-structures.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-25066\"\/>\r\n\r\nNot only is this structure very functional \u2014 as in a user can remove part of the URL and get back to the landing page before it \u2014 but it also clearly tells the user and Google, where they are within the site, and how the content is related.\r\n\r\n<h3>Gauge Your Category Build-Out<\/h3>\r\nAre your categories and\/or subcategory landing pages going to function as a navigational hub for the content to link from, or do you plan on using those landing pages to host their own content?\r\n\r\nIf you\u2019re leaning towards the first option, then you\u2019d want all that link value going to your actual blog content, right?\r\n\r\nRight!\r\n\r\nThen let\u2019s get into some URL structure options you can choose, depending on the size and demand of your site content.\r\n\r\n<h2>Reflect Categories in Your URL Structure<\/h2>\r\n\r\n<blockquote class=\"definition\"><strong>Pro Tip:<\/strong> If your website has navigational categories (like most do), be sure to reflect them and follow their navigational hierarchy in your URL structure.<\/blockquote>\r\n\r\nBelow is an example of a website\u2019s blog, its subcategories and how the URLs could be structured in three different ways:\r\n\r\n<h3>How To Use a Default \u201cCategory\u201d Subfolder<\/h3>\r\nSome larger websites, like e-commerce based ones, will actually have this reflected as \/category\/ in their URLs to help organize products and content. Similarly, with certain <a href=\"https:\/\/wordpress.com\/support\/posts\/categories\/\">Wordpress<\/a> themes, your blog posts can be organized within custom categories that you set up.\r\n\r\nThis may sound appealing for our super-structured folks, however, sometimes this defaults to creating a \/category\/ subfolder within your URL, instead of a custom \/blog\/ one (if that\u2019s what you wanted).\r\n\r\nDepending on your site theme and customizations, you would have to manually alter this <a href=\"https:\/\/jonnyjordan.com\/blog\/how-to-remove-category-from-your-urls-in-wordpress\/\">default URL structure<\/a>  through the Wordpress permalink settings, Yoast plugin settings, or through .htaccess.\r\n\r\nIdeally though, if this structure works for your website, each category landing page would be between ~2\u20133 clicks away from the homepage and subcategory pages no more than four clicks away.\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/6-url-structures.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-25067\" width=\"1400\" height=\"334\">\r\n\r\n<h4>Pros:<\/h4>\r\nThis lets you organize and archive all blog category content within that \u201c\/category\/\u201d subfolder. If you\u2019re using the landing pages for link equity and hosting actual content on them, this would also create an ease of reporting and page tracking.\r\n\r\n<h4>Cons:<\/h4>\r\nLet\u2019s be real \u2014 the URL is long when navigating to the subcategory landing pages, and even longer once a user gets to an actual blog post. This increases the click depth for blog posts to about 4+ clicks away from the homepage.\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/7-url-structures.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-25068\" width=\"1400\" height=\"379\">\r\n\r\n<h3>How To Use a Custom Category Subfolder<\/h3>\r\nConsider not using a default \u201c\/category\/\u201d subfolder at all, and instead just use the navigational, main keyword as the subfolder. \r\n\r\nYou\u2019ll see that the URLs can be condensed to not repeat the main keyword like it is in \/blog\/hair\/hair-trends, and this still makes for a very clean, functional URL.\r\n\r\n<h4>Pros:<\/h4>\r\nThe URL is immediately shortened. This is equally as effective for the user and for Google\u2019s understanding of a site\u2019s structure.\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/8-url-structures.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-25069\" width=\"1400\" height=\"379\">\r\n\r\n<h4>Cons:<\/h4>\r\nThe only con here may be that if it\u2019s important for you to track the actual subcategory landing page performance, it may be less direct, since they won\u2019t be nestled under a universal \/category\/ subfolder.\r\n\r\n<h3>Are Additional Subfolders Needed?<\/h3>\r\nMaybe your website is smaller and won\u2019t have a need for multi-level blog categories. There are also plenty of large sites with success in not using subcategory folders at all, and this may be a great option for you if your main interest is driving link equity to your blog content.\r\n\r\nIt could look something like below, or the subcategories can not exist at all, which would mean all link equity goes straight to the written content living under  \/blog\/.\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/9-url-structures.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-25070\" width=\"1400\" height=\"565\">\r\n\r\n<h4>Pros:<\/h4>\r\nSkipping the subfolders is a clean way to focus on the blog content and drive link equity and rankings straight to the blogs and\/or the top-level category pages. The category subfolders function strictly for site navigation, and no SEO or user experience is lost.\r\n\r\n<h4>Cons:<\/h4>\r\nThe main con here is a matter of preference, really. If your subcategories matter for your site content and structure, then you may consider keeping subfolders throughout your URL structure.\r\n\r\nThis URL structure is also less functional, in that the user cannot just remove the last trail of the URL string and get back to the previous landing page.\r\n\r\nHowever, implementing breadcrumbs is an SEO best practice anyways, and should be used regardless of the URL structure.\r\n\r\n<blockquote class=\"definition\"><strong>Pro Tip:<\/strong> You can always decide to \"noindex\" or canonicalize your category pages if you do not plan to build them out or do not want link equity going there. This would explicitly tell Google crawlers that it should ignore these pages, as they are not preferred or prioritized for rankings or traffic.<\/blockquote>\r\n\r\n<h2>What URL Structure Is Best for SEO?<\/h2>\r\nThe most honest answer we can give is that, it depends.\r\n\r\nThere are three main things to consider:\r\n<ul>\r\n     <li>How big your site is, and how built out your blog category and subcategory pages will be<\/li>\r\n     <li>Where the majority of your site content will live (i.e. \/blog\/)<\/li>\r\n     <li>How you will be prioritizing content to drive traffic and rankings<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/11-url-structures.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-25071\"\/>\r\n\r\nUltimately, we always recommend mocking up your site, whether it\u2019s through a temporary dev site, or even drawn out on a whiteboard or with sticky notes. Consider your top level navigation and any subcategories you may want to follow.\r\n\r\nNarrow down how you\u2019ll prioritize your content, taking click depth into consideration for your most important pages. Then you\u2019ll have a good start on deciding what URL structure fits best to your website\u2019s size and SEO goals.\r\n\r\nIf your SEO needs extend beyond URL structure, you've come to the right place.

Follow the steps below to incorporate it into your next project.\r\n<h3>Grab Attention<\/h3>\r\nLike with any good pick up line, you have to open your content with a hook. This is especially important for <a href=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/marketing\/cold-email-subject-lines\">writing email subject lines<\/a> and article headlines where you often compete with hundreds of others.\r\n\r\nTo come up with <a href=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/creation\/copywriting-tips\">attention-grabbing copy<\/a>, start by thinking about what your audience or customer persona cares about. Consider their background, industry, obstacles, motivations and even seasonality to determine why they may be interested in hearing from you.\r\n\r\n<strong>Do<\/strong>\r\n<ul>\r\n \t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\">Use direct and actionable language<\/li>\r\n \t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\">Invoke emotion with powerful copy<\/li>\r\n \t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\">Ask questions to encourage a response<\/li>\r\n \t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\">Customize to prove relevancy<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n<strong>Don\u2019t<\/strong>\r\n<ul>\r\n \t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\">Use vague and clickbaity words like \u201cimportant,\u201d or \u201cfree!!\u201d<\/li>\r\n \t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\">RELY ON CAPS LOCK \u2014 use your <i>inside<\/i> content voice<\/li>\r\n \t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\">Fake authenticity or compliments<\/li>\r\n \t<li aria-level=\"1\">Use cliches like \u201cDo you have a moment?\u201d<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n<h3>Inspire Interest<\/h3>\r\nNow that you\u2019ve got your audience\u2019s attention, the challenging part is keeping it. Why should they continue reading your email or blog post? For SEO purposes, this can also encourage readers to stick around longer on your page and engage with your content.\r\n\r\nPersonalization is a great way to connect with readers or prospects to show them you understand them. Add in enough information to keep them engaged, but don\u2019t overwhelm them or pile on irrelevant talking points.

This tactic can generate backlinks in three simple steps.\r\n<ol>\r\n \t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>Make a list:<\/strong> List your top 3 competitors that appear to be implementing a content strategy.\r\n(<strong>Pro tip<\/strong> \u2192 think about the frequency of posts, number of sites linking to posts and terms they\u2019re ranking for\u2014are they all branded?)<\/li>\r\n \t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>Find top performing posts:<\/strong> Use tools like Content Explorer in Ahrefs and find posts that bring in the most traffic to your competitors.<\/li>\r\n \t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>Send your pitch:<\/strong> Now it\u2019s time to craft a pitch. Send an outreach email that briefly explains the value the website\u2019s audience will get if they include your brand within the post.<\/li>\r\n<\/ol>\r\n<h3 id=\"move\"><b>Link Moves<\/b><\/h3>\r\nSay you have a new product page that\u2019s been optimized for conversions. A backlink to that page is going to become more valuable than a link to an older product or resource.\r\n\r\nEnter: link moves.\r\n\r\nThis strategy involves repitching sites where you already have a link attributed to your brand. While the older link is still a worthwhile mention, a link to newer resources or product pages will do more for your brand in terms of SEO value and conversions.\r\n\r\nSimilar to link reclamation, the webmaster or journalist you\u2019re reaching out to should see the immediate benefit for their audience by moving the link. Think strategically, considering moves to location-specific pages depending on the audience demographic, existing product mentions in the copy, or informational pages that help explain a complicated sales process.\r\n<h3 id=\"BLB\"><b>Broken Link Building (BLB)\u00a0<\/b><\/h3>\r\nTried and true, broken link building (BLB) is an <a href=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/marketing\/old-school-link-building\">O.G. promotion method<\/a> that survived the Penguin Update and still sees success today. The tactic calls for finding resources that return a 404 or no longer exist, and reaching out to the sites that have linked to that resource.\r\n\r\nBLB works because you\u2019re bringing value to the webmaster (locating a broken link on their page) before you\u2019re coming in with your ask (adding a link to your resource).\r\n\r\nYou should frame your pitch as such so your recipient sees that value as soon as they open the email.\r\n\r\nHere\u2019s what I mean:\r\n\r\n<img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-23636 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/12\/email-request-template.png\" alt=\"broken-link-building-email-template\" width=\"1024\" height=\"600\" \/>\r\n\r\nPrior to pitching a site with broken links, consider the relevance of your content. A resource page for storm chasers won\u2019t care about your guide to financial resources for single parents, and it\u2019s highly unlikely that you\u2019ll generate a backlink.\r\n<h3 id=\"reciprocal\"><b>Reciprocal Linking<\/b><\/h3>\r\nDo you have a large customer network or extensive list of vendors? Reciprocal linking is the process of requesting a link from known contacts\u2014think the food delivery button at the bottom of your favorite website\u2019s restaurant.\r\n\r\nWhile you shouldn\u2019t rely on these type links as a complete backlink strategy, a handful of thoughtful reciprocated link placements is an easy win.\r\n\r\nLet\u2019s think of a less obvious example. Say you\u2019re a local shop who provides toiletries and other amenities to cruise lines and hotel chains. You probably feature them as your client on your website, but do they? Think of the benefits of your brand in terms of their audience. Are you purely organic? Family owned? Small-batch production?\r\n\r\nPitch your vendor with the value-add of the link. Not only will their customers have a direct source to learn more about your product, but you\u2019ll have the extra link juice in tow.\r\n<h3 id=\"guest\"><b>Guest Posting<\/b><\/h3>\r\nGuest posts can be a double edged sword. Kind of like that shrimp cocktail you tried in the cruise buffet line.\r\n\r\nWhile these posts can be an effective way to get in front of new readers, you need to make sure you\u2019re not engaging in <a href=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/marketing\/strategic-vs-tactical-link-building\">tactical link building techniques<\/a>, which can easily get devalued by Google.\r\n\r\nIf you\u2019re going to undertake guest posting as a <a href=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/marketing\/link-building-strategies\">backlink strategy<\/a>, you have to be ready to go above and beyond. Only pitch sites where you have topical authority, and be prepared to write another high-quality post with around 800+ words.\r\n\r\nHere\u2019s an example.\r\n\r\nI do a lot of backpacking, and I was pitching camping printables for my client. I have topical authority from backpacking for 10+ months as a solo female and it\u2019s within my personal brand to write a guest post for a site that creates content around camping for women.\r\n\r\nThe guest blog was genuine and drew from personal experiences and I just happened to be able to tie in my client\u2019s page with the piece, without diluting authority.\r\n\r\nTypically, you\u2019ll have editorial guidelines to follow as a guest blogger, and there will be a formal process to publish the piece.\r\n\r\nTake a look:\r\n\r\n<img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-23637 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/12\/guest-posting.png\" alt=\"guest-posting-example-email\" width=\"1024\" height=\"700\" \/>\r\n\r\n<strong>Pro tip \u2192<\/strong> make yourself available after the post goes live to answer comments.\r\n<h2><b>Mid-Term Link Building Tactics<\/b><\/h2>\r\nThe mid-term backlink strategies we\u2019ll touch on include pitching your long-form guides and infographics to <a href=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/marketing\/link-relevancy\">relevant websites<\/a>. Best for brands with shareable top-funnel content.\r\n<h3 id=\"long-form\"><b>Long-Form Resources<\/b><\/h3>\r\nPitching long-form resources looks similar to finding sites with broken links. You\u2019ll use the same types of <a href=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/marketing\/google-search-operators\">Google search operators<\/a> (ie. inurl:resources | intitle:helpful-links | inurl:links), however you\u2019ll be pitching your guide as a new resource, instead of replacing a link.\r\n\r\nSite and post relevance is key here. Consider adding additional Google search operators that will narrow down your search. If you\u2019re pitching a resource for veterans, you may want to use operators like intitle:military or intext:veteran.\r\n\r\nYour value add is crucial. You want to make sure the resource your pitching is better than existing content to provide value to your prospect\u2019s audience.\r\n<h3 id=\"rec\"><b>Link Reclamation<\/b><\/h3>\r\n<a href=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/marketing\/advanced-link-reclamation\">Link reclamation<\/a>, or unlinked mentions, is the process of finding your brand referenced online without a backlink to your website. You\u2019ll find these mentions in online publications, social media posts, product reviews, and everything in between.\r\n\r\nThese tactics work when established brands already have some buzz, and can create link opportunities to extremely valuable bottom-funnel pages. Link reclamation is unique to your brand, and your competitors can\u2019t replicate these links, because the websites were already talking about you.\r\n\r\nShine on, captain.\r\n\r\nLet\u2019s talk logistics. By reaching out to the person who wrote the post, you can present your link as a way for their readers to find more information, and therefore provide value before your big ask.\r\n\r\nHere\u2019s what it looks like:\r\n\r\n<b><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-23638 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/12\/rQqXZdTQ.png\" alt=\"link-reclamation-example-email\" width=\"1024\" height=\"735\" \/><\/b>\r\n\r\nNotice that this email focuses on brevity. Journalists are busy, and they get hundreds of emails per day. Keep your pitch short and to the point so they can scan it easily. Make sure to include a link to the post your brand is mentioned in\u2014again, journalists are busy, and they\u2019re not going to want to dig through old posts to do you a solid.\r\n<h3 id=\"review\"><b>Review Roundups<\/b><\/h3>\r\nYou\u2019re in an industry where relevant keywords ranking in the SERP are formatted as \u201cBest X\u201d. Instead of trying to rank higher than the post with \u201c136 Best \u2026\u201d it might be a better strategy to simply ask for your product to be included.\r\n\r\nCraft your pitch to make your value proposition apparent. If you\u2019re a software booking company, and there\u2019s a list of \u201cX Best Booking Softwares for Cruise Lines,\u201d you\u2019ll want to feature why your software is different. If the post is missing a better booking system, they\u2019re likely going to include your link to create a more comprehensive guide for their audience.\r\n\r\n<strong>Disclaimer:<\/strong> Advertising or \u201cpublishing fees\u201d may be requested.\r\n<h2><b>Long-Term Link Building Tactics<\/b><\/h2>\r\nIn this last section, we focus on link building tactics that have the most <a href=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/conversation\/long-vs-short-linkbuilding\">ROI in the long-term<\/a> for cost per link and organic link placements.\r\n\r\nFeeling a bit eager to dive in?\r\n\r\nBefore we get too deep into the strategy, let\u2019s level set.\r\n\r\nThese tactics typically involve a higher investment of time or money up front. The good news? Your competition can\u2019t replicate these showstopping pieces easily because of the high investment they take to generate success.\r\n<h3 id=\"high-tier\"><b>High-Tier News Coverage<\/b><\/h3>\r\nIn link building, the highest form of validation seems to be coverage from a high-end news source with a 90+ domain authority linking to your content. If BLB is the budget cruise line of link building, high-tier news coverage is like the private yacht.\r\n\r\nBut how do you get the attention of journalists who get hundreds of emails per day?\r\n<blockquote>Data + value-added pitch = coverage.<\/blockquote>\r\nHere comes the intimidating part. You have to gather data and create a piece that highlights enough points so journalists can put the spin on it they want to. You can do this with surveys, analyzing data from Google trends, or even using proprietary data.\r\n\r\nTake a look:\r\n\r\n<img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-23639 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/12\/N6JhaLVw.png\" alt=\"high-tier-news-outreach-example\" width=\"1024\" height=\"854\" \/>\r\n\r\nThis email cuts the fluff, and pitches a piece offering interesting data handed to the journalist with a story idea on a silver platter. The easier you make it for a journalist to envision the headline, the more likely you are to get that placement.\r\n<h3 id=\"passive\"><b>Passive Link Acquisition\u00a0<\/b><\/h3>\r\nPassive link acquisition is arguably the strategy that generates the highest ROI and lowest cost per link over time. Long after you\u2019re done with outreach, your post will continue generating organic placements and rank in a <a href=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/marketing\/organic-discovery-vs-pitchable-serps\">pitchable SERP<\/a>.\r\n\r\nThese SEO linking strategies can include statistics posts, definitional posts, and top-funnel topics with high search intent along with a shareable asset. While these pieces don\u2019t generate as many links up front, after 6+ months they begin to reap SEO backlinks and gain traction in the SERP.\r\n\r\nFor example, this statistics post by <a href=\"https:\/\/www.pandasecurity.com\/mediacenter\/news\/covid-cybersecurity-statistics\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Panda Security<\/a> is ranking #9 in the SERP for \u201ccybersecurity statistics\u201d and has racked up 75 linking root domains and counting since it\u2019s publish date in October 2020.\r\n\r\n<img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-23640 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/12\/EE-9Xpg.png\" alt=\"panda-security-stats-post\" width=\"1024\" height=\"995\" \/>\r\n\r\nNaturally, other sites begin to reference your post as it gains more authority. Not only can these garner organic links from mid-tier sites, but they can also achieve top-tier coverage naturally. Not to mention, these links are the least likely to be devalued by Google should another core update come along to rock the content marketing boat.\r\n<h2><b>TL;DR<\/b><\/h2>\r\nIn case you didn\u2019t notice, there was a common theme throughout this post, and I\u2019m not talking about cruises. You can learn how to get backlinks with one overarching <a href=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/services\/content-marketing\">content marketing strategy<\/a>: <strong>add value for your prospects and their audience.<\/strong>\r\n\r\nWhether you\u2019re pitching to journalists and the story needs to get approved by their editor or busy mom blogs that also write about side hustles. The benefit of including a backlink to your piece should be clear as a Bahamian day for your prospect from the moment they open your email."

There are many reasons why you need this content type in your strategy closet.\r\n\r\nIn this post we\u2019ll cover the definition of evergreen content, why it\u2019s important, <a href=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/strategy\/content-marketing-examples\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">content examples<\/a>, how to create it, tips to level-up existing evergreen posts and even how to turn \u201cseasonal\u201d pieces into evergreen result-drivers.\r\n\r\nSiege Media creates hundreds of high-performing evergreen content pieces per year. In fact, our total client traffic impact is <a href=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/work\">more than $90,000,000<\/a>, and that's only made possible through content that stands the test of time.\r\n<h2><strong>What is Evergreen Content?<\/strong><\/h2>\r\nEvergreen content is relevant year-round. It doesn\u2019t depend on a season, date or event to be topical and shareable. Evergreen articles and design assets are a staple in any successful content strategy.\r\n<h3><strong>Evergreen Content vs Seasonal Content<\/strong><\/h3>\r\nSeasonal content doesn\u2019t have the shelf-life of evergreen content and doesn\u2019t appeal to users year-round. Things like holiday content, sporting events, politics, industry trends. \r\n\r\nMore specifically, pieces like \u201cThe Best Valentine\u2019s Gifts,\u201d \u201c<a href=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/strategy\/coronavirus-content-marketing\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">COVID Content Strategy<\/a>,\u201d \u201cSummer Workout Ideas,\u201d \u201cYour Ultimate Back to School Checklist\u201d are all only topical in their respective seasons or timeframes.\r\n<h3><strong>When Evergreen Content is a Bad Fit<\/strong><\/h3>\r\nThere is definitely a time and place for seasonal content.

Just because a certain format or subject is successful for one site or brand, that doesn\u2019t mean it will work for you. You should try to be strategic in the formats and topics you select so they\u2019re not only evergreen but also on-brand. Below we\u2019ll cover some additional examples and why they work.\r\n\r\n<img class=\"alignnone wp-image-23168 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/11\/evergreen_instructional-screenshot.png\" alt=\"screenshot of a in-post image of hoe to clean a cast iron pan\" width=\"1401\" height=\"778\" \/>\r\n\r\nInstructional pieces work very well because they clearly answer search intent and provide the solution that\u2019s being looked for.\r\n<h3><strong>How-to\u2019s<\/strong><\/h3>\r\nAlso known as step-by-steps, these pieces work because they provide easy-to-follow instructions to complete a task.

Think of data-focused topics that still matter year-round, like <a href=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/strategy\/content-marketing-statistics\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">content marketing stats<\/a>. Data-centric pieces may require more frequent (usually annual) updates but the overarching topic remains relevant.\r\n<h3><strong>4.

Content strategy is a lot like that but with way less yolk. Okay, but in all seriousness, your content strategy should be diversified. If you rely solely on viral content that\u2019s only relevant now, you\u2019re going to miss out on reliable content that will build value over time.\r\n<h3 id=\"content\"><strong>Content Strategy Diversification\u00a0<\/strong><\/h3>\r\nWe aren\u2019t saying there isn\u2019t value in viral or seasonal content, they can help grab visibility and cut through saturated feeds and search engine result pages. But catchy news stories and punchy seasonal content can only take you so far. You may see your traffic results spike with a well-placed holiday post or viral story but that spike will likely be short-lived. In order to have a balanced strategy that drives MoM and YoY growth, you should be creating pieces that are relevant year-round in addition to those more seasonal pieces.\r\n<h3><strong>Build Momentum For a Fledgling Site\u00a0\u00a0<\/strong><\/h3>\r\nWhen building visibility for a new site or a brand that\u2019s newer to the content game, it\u2019s best to build up your evergreen content library to get some steady growth. Oftentimes newer sites or brands have smaller budgets so they can\u2019t afford to create content that won\u2019t return on its value or \u201cflop.\u201d A well-executed evergreen piece is a safer choice when you\u2019re working with a limited budget.\r\n<h3><strong>Solid Linkability and Repromotion Potential<\/strong><\/h3>\r\nNot only can you gain more consistent traffic but you can also garner backlinks at a steadier rate. Backlinks are the gift that keeps on giving \u2014 they signal to Google that your piece is worth reading, linking to and worth serving up to other readers. It can boost your individual post ranking and help elevate the domain authority for your site as a whole. If there\u2019s ever a month that you\u2019re short on your backlinking goals, evergreen content is there to save the day.\r\n\r\nFor example, your infographic on holiday decoration ideas won\u2019t be helpful in June since it<em> tis\u2019nt the season<\/em>. Instead, you\u2019d want to have something already on-deck that resonates with readers no matter the time, something like \u201cHow to Declutter Your Home.\u201d A piece like that is something you can go back to and repromote should you have a slower <a href=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/seo\/what-is-link-building\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">link building<\/a> month or hit a production lull.\r\n<h2><strong>How To Create Evergreen Content<\/strong><\/h2>\r\nYou\u2019ll find that different strategies and workflows work best for different industries and niches. There isn\u2019t a one-size-fits-all content formula but I think we got pretty close with these five steps below.\r\n<h3><strong>1. Think Through Your Strategy<\/strong><\/h3>\r\nPlanning your evergreen content strategy is the first thing you should do before attempting to create any content. You should take a look at your blog categories, product offerings and buyer personas. There are a wide variety of strategy methodologies and strategies aren\u2019t one size fits all. Your strategy should take into account your site size, goals and offerings. Some questions to ask yourself to help drive your strategy could include:\r\n<ul>\r\n \t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What blog categories or <a href=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/seo\/topic-clusters\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">topic clusters<\/a> connect best with your offerings?<\/li>\r\n \t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What types of queries could you see your audience searching for?<\/li>\r\n \t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Which topics are closest to your brand? Which topics are topical year-round?<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\nYou don\u2019t want to go into content creation without any prior planning. This could cause unnecessary work down the line if you have to implement heavy redirects, unnecessary content revamps, site or blog structure changes, among other things. If you\u2019re unclear about where to start we have some guides that could be of help:\r\n<ul>\r\n \t<li>Building an <a href=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/seo\/content-strategy\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">SEO content strategy<\/a><\/li>\r\n \t<li>How to <a href=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/strategy\/increase-website-traffic\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">increase your web traffic<\/a><\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n<h3><strong>2. Find Your Evergreen Keywords<\/strong><\/h3>\r\nFinding the right keyword can feel like a mini jackpot. If you have your strategy or keyword list already built-out start working through that, if not, you can:\r\n<ul>\r\n \t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Look at your products and work backward to find content connections<\/li>\r\n \t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Find inspiration in customer reviews or questions<\/li>\r\n \t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Go to Reddit and other social media to see what your community is talking about (don\u2019t fall for trends)<\/li>\r\n \t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Use trend tools like Google Trends to see the longevity of a keyword<\/li>\r\n \t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Think about adjacent topics that appeal to your ideal consumer<\/li>\r\n \t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\">See what competitors cover<\/li>\r\n \t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Use <a href=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/seo\/kwr-emerging-trends\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">keyword research<\/a> tools<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\nAs you build up the keywords you want to go after and the content itself, make sure you start tracking that progress. While executing keyword research, you want to look for and consider:\r\n<ul>\r\n \t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Search intent, or what the user is really searching for, and how you can execute to match it<\/li>\r\n \t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Informational vs purchase driven, steer clear of SERPs riddled with product pages<\/li>\r\n \t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\">See who\u2019s ranking and your ability to outrank them<\/li>\r\n \t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Extra SERP signals like video carousels, featured snippets, people also ask, etc.<\/li>\r\n \t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Click volume that is at least half of the search volume<\/li>\r\n \t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Keyword difficulty that\u2019s attainable based on your goals<\/li>\r\n \t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Audience and outreach market<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n<h3><strong>3. Write Well-Structured Evergreen Copy<\/strong><\/h3>\r\n<div class=\"video-container\"><iframe src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/eD5rNgexJIU\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"><\/iframe><\/div>\r\nWhen creating an evergreen piece, you want to pay special attention to SEO best practices. In news pieces and or those focused solely on a viral story, things like word count, keyword density, scannability and piece structure aren\u2019t as important. \r\n\r\nWith an evergreen piece, you\u2019re going for longevity so you\u2019ll want to make sure the piece structure is as durable as the topic. See these guides below for those best practices:\r\n<ul>\r\n \t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Guide to <a href=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/strategy\/on-page-content-marketing-best-practices\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">on-page content marketing best practices<\/a><\/li>\r\n \t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Guide on the <a href=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/strategy\/leveling-up-success-method\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">SUCCESS model<\/a> to create 10x content<\/li>\r\n \t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Collection of tried and true <a href=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/creation\/blog-post-templates\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">blog post templates<\/a><\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n<h3><strong>4. Create Evergreen Design and Shareables<\/strong><\/h3>\r\nNot every topic lends itself to a shareable element but you should have a good idea of which topics do by examining the SERP and user intent. Adding visuals and various design assets can help set your piece apart from others and make people more likely to share, hence \u201cshareable.\u201d Unsure of how to do this? Check out:\r\n<ul>\r\n \t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\">How to generate <a href=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/creation\/linkable-asset-ideas\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">linkable asset ideas<\/a><\/li>\r\n \t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Why and <a href=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/creation\/why-and-how-infographics-work\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">how infographics work<\/a><\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\nKeep in mind that the advantages of evergreen apply to design as well. An evergreen graphic or design can help increase linkability and bolster re-promotion efforts.\r\n<h3><strong>5. Update As Needed<\/strong><\/h3>\r\nJust because a piece of content is evergreen, that doesn\u2019t mean that you just set it and forget it. Depending on the topic, almost all posts will need some sort of refresh at some point to maintain their success. \r\n\r\nAlgorithms change and ranking factors shift and when they do, your content may need to be tweaked. Some of the most common ways to know you need a refresh include:\r\n<ul>\r\n \t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong><a href=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/marketing\/diversity-equity-inclusion\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Out-of-date phrasing<\/a> or dates:<\/strong> This is the most obvious indicator. If your piece has a year in the title or centers around data from a certain time period, see if you can find more relevant data.<\/li>\r\n \t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>Decreased rankings:<\/strong> The next indicator you should look out for is a decrease in rankings. Tracking your content\u2019s performance is a must. Decreased rankings are a key sign that it\u2019s time to update your content. We<\/li>\r\n \t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>Slowed link velocity:<\/strong> You\u2019re used to seeing a lot of links come in for a certain piece and suddenly those returns begin to dwindle.<\/li>\r\n \t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>Unexpected changes<\/strong>: You should also keep an eye out for mentions of current events or recommended practices that are no longer relevant as well as national or global changes. Make sure you update any irrelevant content.<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n<h2><strong>Tips To Level Up Your Existing Evergreen Posts\u00a0<\/strong><\/h2>\r\nJust as posts need to be refreshed over time, there\u2019s almost always some sort of room for improvement. Try to find ways to add value and expand content into <a href=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/marketing\/multiple-outreach-markets\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">multiple outreach markets<\/a>. Below we\u2019ll show you some ways to level up your existing evergreen articles:\r\n<ul>\r\n \t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>Add an interactive or shareable element<\/strong> but only if the topic warrants it. You don\u2019t want to throw in something just for the sake of pizazz but also so it adds value. Some examples of this could be a demonstrational video, custom photography, animated graphics, printables, etc.<\/li>\r\n \t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>Add a news-worthy element<\/strong> because content balance goes both ways. If you\u2019re looking for ways to build links to a high-priority topic see if there\u2019s a relevant survey or data study angle that enhances the piece and drives interest.<\/li>\r\n \t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>Get an expert opinion<\/strong> to increase topic authority. Not only is this a value-add, but it also helps you engage your community. If you\u2019re lucky, they might share the piece with their own audience for additional exposure.<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\nBefore you think of dropping a ton of cash on a Terry Crews cameo for your \u201cHow To Save Money\u201d video, please remember that you shouldn\u2019t add in an element that doesn't make sense, bring value for the reader or make fiscal sense on what you\u2019d get in return.\r\n<h2><strong>How To Make \u201cSeasonal\u201d Topics Relevant Year-Round\u00a0<\/strong><\/h2>\r\nNot all non-evergreen content is a lost cause. There are ways that you can spin an existing piece of content to make it evergreen. It\u00a0 centers around finding a complementary topic that has evergreen search potential.\r\n<h3><strong>Provide a Solution For a Survey or News Story\u00a0<\/strong><\/h3>\r\nA survey or news story on its own may not be evergreen, but you could add more to it. Make the survey findings the hook of your piece and then add evergreen information.\r\n\r\nFor example, you could update your survey piece \u201cX% of People Haven\u2019t Changed Their Password in X Years\u201d to \u201cHow Often Should You Change Your Password? X% of People Are At-Risk.\u201d The key phrase, \u201chow often should you change your password\u201d has a search volume of 350, ties into your initial survey perfectly and gives readers actionable information that helps them become more secure.\r\n<h3><strong>Tie in a Related Topic<\/strong><\/h3>\r\nTying in a tangential topic can to <em>evergreen-ify<\/em> a post. Let\u2019s say you have a post about \u201cBest Friend\u2019s Day,\u201d try adding some actionable info to beef up the piece.\u00a0 For example, this could be \u201cX Ways To Support Your Friends on Best Friend\u2019s Day and Year-Round.\u201d. If properly built, the traffic from \u201csupport your friends\u201d (search volume 350) will not only bring in traffic year-round but also help you rank higher when \u201cBest Friend\u2019s Day\u201d returns.\r\n<h3><strong>Overhaul a Post\u00a0<\/strong><\/h3>\r\nUse the previous success of a (no-longer) timely piece and revamp it. The links and authority it garnered can help boost the revamped piece so long as they\u2019re closely related.\r\n\r\nFor example, let\u2019s say you have an old piece called \u201cX Fitness Tips from 2016 Olympic Stars\u201d \u2014 it actually got a decent amount of links but now it\u2019s sitting there collecting dust in your blog archive and not ranking for anything notable. You\u2019re ready to just redirect the piece but think again.\r\n\r\nTry updating the post annually for each Olympics. Take a look at the SERP and see what you need to do to bring this piece to par and beyond. Re-structure the post and take out out-of-date references and the pre-existing link \u201cjuice\u201d should help move you up.\r\n<h2><strong>Content That Lasts Forever<\/strong><\/h2>\r\nNo matter your industry, there is an evergreen strategy out there for you. Amongst all of your keyword research and meticulous outlining, remember that great content satisfies the search intent of the reader and offers more than they can currently find anywhere else. Strive to be the most helpful and the best at fulfilling that search intent. Helpful evergreen content \u2014 like the little black dress \u2014 never goes out of style."

HARO not only helps journalists save time sourcing quotes, but it also allows businesses and subject matter experts to share their knowledge.\r\n\r\nSo, how does it work?\r\n\r\nHARO allows you to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.helpareporter.com\/subscriptions\/basic\/?nav_location=main_menu\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">sign up<\/a> as a reporter, a source or both. From there, you can personalize your profile to include your specific industry or expertise.\r\n\r\n<img class=\"alignnone wp-image-23230 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/11\/post-image-1-1-1.png\" alt=\"example of HARO preferences\" width=\"1400\" height=\"586\" \/>\r\n\r\nIf you\u2019re signed up as a source, HARO will use this information to curate a list of topics that may be relevant to you and send you an email about three times a day.\r\n\r\n<strong>Here\u2019s a quick overview of how it works<\/strong>:\r\n<ol>\r\n \t<li>Bloggers and journalists will submit queries. These are requests for sources.<\/li>\r\n \t<li>HARO will send these queries out three times a day at 5:35 a.m., 12:35 p.m. and 5:35 p.m. EST.<\/li>\r\n \t<li>Sources will reply to relevant queries.<\/li>\r\n \t<li>Your inbox will be flooded with a variety of valuable sources to use in your next story!<\/li>\r\n<\/ol>\r\nIf you\u2019re a reporter, HARO can help you find expert quotes for your upcoming article. It can also help you gauge what topics other companies are creating content on. If you\u2019re signed up as a source, this will help you find upcoming pieces that you can lend a quote to.\r\n<a name=\"whentouse\"><\/a>\r\n<h2>When to Use HARO for Your Content<\/h2>\r\nWhen done right, HARO can level up your content and <a href=\"https:\/\/harohelpers.com\/how-to-use-haro-for-seo-and-why\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">strengthen your SEO strategy<\/a>, but it shouldn\u2019t be used for every piece. Below are some tell-tale signs your content could use the boost of HARO.\r\n<h3>You Don\u2019t Have Authority<\/h3>\r\nSay you\u2019ve conducted <a href=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/seo\/kwr-emerging-trends\">keyword research<\/a> and you\u2019ve landed on a topic that has the potential to rank, but you don\u2019t have total authority in the space. Sourcing quotes from experts that do have authority can help you fill that knowledge gap. With the growing importance of E-A-T for content, sourcing expert quotes in areas you may not typically be authoritative can help you gain that expert insight on your piece.\r\n<h3>You Notice Other Ranking Posts Have Quotes<\/h3>\r\nBefore conducting research on any <a href=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/creation\/how-to-write-a-good-blog-post\">blog post<\/a>, you should analyze the SERP to see what type of content Google is prioritizing for that keyword. If you notice that several of the ranking articles include expert quotes in their piece, it's a good sign that you should do the same.\r\n<h3>You Lack Expertise in the Area<\/h3>\r\nThose in <a href=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/\">content marketing<\/a> know that sometimes you\u2019ll be faced with writing on a topic you know nothing about. Instead of just winging it and trying to cram years of knowledge into a few days, source quotes from experts instead. Not only will this help you shape your piece, but it will also help add that \u201cexpertise\u201d element to your content that may have been missing otherwise. This is especially important for <a href=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/seo\/ymyl\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Your Money or Your Life (YMYL) topics<\/a>.\r\n<a name=\"downsides\"><\/a>\r\n<h2>The Downsides to HARO<\/h2>\r\nHARO has been around for awhile and it has largely been taken over by SEOs. With that said, HARO should not be your end-all-be-all for building links.\r\n\r\nDepending on your pitch and project, you may receive a pool of unqualified responses \u2014 or you may get no responses at all. On top of that, some responses will be from sites that have a low DA or have nothing to do with your pitch. That\u2019s why taking the time to craft a successful pitch is so important.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, you may receive a ton of qualified responses with fantastic supplementary quotes to support your article, but that doesn\u2019t mean you're guaranteed a link. Depending on your outreach tactics, you may receive a majority of social media shares instead. It\u2019s also tough to receive any money page or homepage links as most experts will just share the article.\r\n\r\nWhile there are many pros to adding this tactic to your link building strategy, it will require a bit of patience and detail to receive the high-quality links you\u2019re after.\r\n<a name=\"pitch\"><\/a>\r\n<h2>How to Write a Successful HARO Pitch<\/h2>\r\nOnce you've brainstormed which piece of content you want to use HARO for, it\u2019s time to write your pitch.\r\n<h3>1. Submit a Query<\/h3>\r\nAfter you\u2019ve set up your account, go to <a href=\"https:\/\/app.helpareporter.com\/reporters\/queries\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">this page<\/a> to submit a query. This is the most important section as it determines how many \u2014 if any \u2014 responses you get as well as the number of qualified submissions you\u2019ll receive.\r\n\r\n<img class=\"alignnone wp-image-23232 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/11\/post-image-2-1.png\" alt=\"example of HARO query details\" width=\"1400\" height=\"932\" \/>\r\n\r\n<strong>Media Outle<\/strong>t: Put the name of the website or publication you\u2019re requesting a source for. You also have the option to keep this information anonymous.\r\n\r\n<strong>Outlet URL<\/strong>: In this section, put the URL of the site your piece of content will be published on.\r\n\r\n<strong>Summary<\/strong>: Your summary is just like an <a href=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/marketing\/cold-email-subject-lines\">email subject line<\/a> \u2014 it should be specific and easy to understand. We\u2019ve found that summaries in the form of a question are the most successful. For example, if you were writing a piece on the benefits of content marketing your summary might look like this: \u201cWhat are the biggest benefits of content marketing?\u201d\r\n\r\nAnother tactic is to add in the exact profile of who you\u2019re looking for. This will make it easy for sources to sift through the variety of queries they see a day. For example, you could write: \u201cSeeking small business owners and CEOs to comment on their career journey.\u201d\r\n\r\n<strong>Query<\/strong>: The query should include a general description of your story. Make sure to include any direct questions or opinions you\u2019re looking for. You should also include what format the story will be published on \u2014 print, radio, online news or a website.\r\n\r\nIf you\u2019re writing for a site that has a high domain authority make sure to include that as well. We\u2019ve found that including a high DA site will encourage higher response rates.\r\n\r\n<strong>Requirements<\/strong>: You should set strict requirements to filter out any unqualified sources. Just saying you\u2019re looking for \u201cany personal finance expert\u201d will open up a flood gate of anyone who has ever studied personal finance.\r\n\r\nMake requirements as specific as possible. For example, if you\u2019re looking for experts for your piece on content marketing say: \u201cMust be an SEO Manager, Director of SEO, Director of Marketing or a CMO at a mid-size enterprise.\u201d\r\n\r\nHere\u2019s an example of a HARO request we submitted in the past:\r\n\r\n<img class=\"alignnone wp-image-23233 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/11\/post-image-3-1.png\" alt=\"example HARO pitch \" width=\"1400\" height=\"497\" \/>\r\n\r\nBecause we specified that we were looking for sleep and dream experts, we got a handful of qualified sources right away. We also mentioned exactly what questions we wanted them to answer. This helped us avoid any unrelated commentary or opinions on the subject matter and made it easier for us to organize the different quotes we received.\r\n<h3>2. Target Specific Sources<\/h3>\r\n<img class=\"alignnone wp-image-23234 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/11\/post-image-4-1.png\" alt=\"target specific sources in HARO\" width=\"1400\" height=\"402\" \/>\r\nThis section is pretty straightforward. Select the categories your query fits into. If you aren\u2019t sure what to put for the second category, select \u201cGeneral\u201d to cast a wider net of sources.\r\n<h3>3. Set a Deadline<\/h3>\r\n<img class=\"alignnone wp-image-23235 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/11\/post-image-5-1.png\" alt=\"how to set a deadline using HARO\" width=\"1400\" height=\"628\" \/>\r\nAccording to HARO, hundreds of queries are prioritized each day based on urgency and they\u2019ll work to approve queries two days prior to their deadlines. To get the best responses, set a deadline of around four or more days. If you\u2019re in a bind and only have a few days to gather responses, you can mark your request as \u201curgent.\u201d HARO will prioritize your request and push it out as quickly as possible.\r\n\r\nAfter you submit your request, the team at HARO will review it to make sure it meets their standards. You\u2019ll then receive an email that your request has been accepted. If your request gets denied, review their <a href=\"https:\/\/app.helpareporter.com\/reporters\/rules\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">journalist rules<\/a> to make sure you\u2019re adhering to their guidelines.\r\n<a name=\"responses\"><\/a>\r\n<h2>Tips for Managing Your Responses<\/h2>\r\nOnce your query is submitted, you\u2019ll start to see responses flood your inbox about two days before your deadline. We\u2019ve seen queries get anywhere from five to 50 responses.\r\n\r\nWhile going through your usual day-to-day, it can be stressful having to filter through the plethora of pitches you\u2019ll receive. Below are our top tips for staying organized.\r\n<h3>Create a Gmail Label<\/h3>\r\n<img class=\"alignnone wp-image-23237 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/11\/post-image-6-1.png\" alt=\"how to create a Gmail label\" width=\"1400\" height=\"695\" \/>\r\n\r\nTo help declutter your email inbox, create a new Gmail label to organize the responses you receive. You can title it: HARO \u2014 [SUMMARY OF PITCH]. Then, start moving each pitch to this new folder to help you stay organized and keep everything in one place. If you don\u2019t use Gmail, other email providers should provide the same type of email filtering.\r\n<h3>Use Google Sheets to Organize Your Pitches<\/h3>\r\nTo make sure nothing slips through the cracks and no pitch goes unopened, create a sheet to organize the pitches you receive. Make sure to include a section for the person's name, contact information, the company site and the DA of that site. This will help you easily reach out to contacts once your post goes live. Then you can prioritize quotes from experts with higher DA sites.\r\n\r\n<img class=\"alignnone wp-image-23238 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/11\/post-image-7-1.png\" alt=\"Google sheet template to organize pitches\" width=\"1400\" height=\"440\" \/>\r\nIf you\u2019ve asked several questions in your query, you can organize your columns by question. This will make it easier for you to sort through when building out your piece. To help, we\u2019ve created an example sheet to show you how we\u2019ve organized projects in the past.\r\n\r\nDownload the Google sheet below and customize it to fit your query and pitches.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"https:\/\/docs.google.com\/spreadsheets\/d\/1q1tiU4TvKH09MgMQIlPORkgyxX8F5hKHHahNbg0XgX8\/edit?usp=sharing\"><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-23239 size-medium\" src=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/11\/download-google-sheet-button-1-400x75.png\" alt=\"download Google sheet button\" width=\"400\" height=\"75\" \/><\/a>\r\n<a name=\"buildlinks\"><\/a>\r\n<h2>How to Use HARO to Build Links<\/h2>\r\nOne thing people love almost as much as being quoted \u2014 bragging about the different publications they were featured on! Once you\u2019ve built out your piece and have pushed it live, notify the people you\u2019ve featured.\r\n\r\nBy including experts in your content, you can now use this opportunity to reach out to them and ask them to share your piece. If your piece of content is done well and on an established site, the more likely you are to get that link or share.\r\n\r\nThis is called <strong>mentioned outreach<\/strong>. It\u2019s an effective way to build links, but is commonly overlooked.\r\n\r\nUsing your Google sheet, organize your pitches by domain authority. This will help you prioritize the sites where a link placement is more valuable.\r\n\r\nHere\u2019s an example of an email template we\u2019ve used in the past:\r\n\r\n<img class=\"alignnone wp-image-23241 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/11\/post-image-8-1.png\" alt=\"example mentioned outreach template\" width=\"1400\" height=\"765\" \/>\r\n\r\nThe subject line is simple. It gets straight to the point without giving the prospect too much information \u2014 enticing them to open it.\r\n\r\nIn the body of your email, flatter the prospect. Thank them for their expert insight and let them know your article is now live. Provide them with an easily accessible link, so they don\u2019t have to do any heavy lifting.\r\n\r\nYour closing line is the most important part. Let them know that if they love the content, they have your full permission to share on their website and social channels. Offer to send through high-resolution images, an embed code for the visual or custom copy to make their sharing process even easier.\r\n<h2>Level Up Your Link Building Strategy<\/h2>\r\nWhen building links, the goal is to land authority placements. However, those are often the hardest to acquire and using <a href=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/marketing\/google-search-operators\">google search operators<\/a> can only get you so far. If your team has been stuck garnering the same low-quality links each month, consider adding HARO to your <a href=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/services\/link-building\">link building strategy<\/a>.\r\n\r\nWhether you\u2019re a journalist or a source, HARO can help you build links and awareness to yourself, your company or your clients. It will also work in tandem with your current content marketing strategy \u2014 helping you build a more authoritative piece and opening the door to a new pool of prospects. You just have to know how to use the tool right.\r\n\r\nWithout a successfully crafted pitch and proven outreach method, you may be left with no responses at all. Hopefully our guide above can help you avoid that. Just remember \u2014 the platform requires a bit of patience and practice, but the effort is worth the gain."

    "title": "What is SEO Content? How to Create Content That Ranks",
    "content": "Content marketers love to toss around buzzwords.\r\n\r\nFrom going after low-hanging fruit to growth hacking your way into existence, these terms have truth to them, but the meaning gets lost if overused.\r\n\r\nSEO has become a buzzword too. People who don\u2019t truly understand the term and its requirements use it to impress clients or prove credibility. As an agency that offers <a href=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/services\/seo\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">SEO services<\/a> and has an emphasis on SEO-focused content marketing, these people make us look bad.\r\n\r\nTo set the record straight, we decided to go back to the basics. Here is a guide on what SEO content actually is, why your business needs it and how to create optimized content that Google will rank.\r\n<h2>What is SEO Content?<\/h2>\r\nSEO content is content written with the intent of ranking on a search engine like Google. SEO stands for \u201csearch engine optimization.\u201d\r\n\r\nThere are certain elements such as keywords, site structure and copywriting that search engines look at to determine if a piece of content fits what the searcher is looking for. If your content isn't properly optimized, the search engine won\u2019t rank your content in the top results.\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/10\/sec-content-1.png\" alt=\"graphic describing what seo content is\" width=\"1400\" height=\"450\" \/>\r\n\r\nGoogle\u2019s ranking algorithm has changed over the years, but website content is a consistent factor. When looking at the impact of content as a ranking factor, a <a href=\"https:\/\/moz.com\/blog\/weighting-the-clusters-of-ranking-factors-in-google-analytics-whiteboard-friday\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">study by Moz<\/a> weighted page-level keywords and content features at 15 percent importance and a more recent <a href=\"https:\/\/www.uptimiser.com.hk\/seo-google-ranking-factors\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">study<\/a> weighted on-site content as 18-21 percent importance. So, while a website\u2019s technical structure should be <a href=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/strategy\/website-seo-work-of-art\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">optimized for SEO<\/a>, creating well-structured content is also key.\r\n<h2>SEO Content Helps Businesses<\/h2>\r\nThere are many reasons to <a href=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/creation\/content-creator\">create content<\/a>. Some posts may be used to boost your credibility in the industry while others are used to build links to your website. SEO content does a little of both, and can significantly increase your website traffic along the way.\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/10\/seo-content-2.png\" alt=\"graphic showing why businesses should create seo content\" width=\"1400\" height=\"520\" \/>\r\n<h3>Boosts Organic Traffic<\/h3>\r\nCreating SEO-driven content that ranks will drive organic traffic to your website. You can see this happen in any industry.\r\n\r\nIn the floral space, the keyword \u201corchid care\u201d has 32,000 monthly searches. The <a href=\"https:\/\/www.ftd.com\/blog\/share\/orchid-care\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">FTD post<\/a> ranking #1 drives monthly organic traffic of 17,293 visits per month.\r\n\r\n<img class=\"alignnone wp-image-22300 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/10\/seo-content-3-2.png\" alt=\"graphic showing a post ranking for orchid care\" width=\"1401\" height=\"723\" \/>\r\n\r\nWhen looking at the <a href=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/seo\/financial-services\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">finance industry<\/a>, the keyword \u201caverage grocery bill for 2\u201d has 1,100 monthly searches but the <a href=\"https:\/\/mint.intuit.com\/blog\/food-budgets\/monthly-grocery-budget-calculator\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">top result<\/a> drives monthly organic traffic of 11,400 visits per month.\r\n\r\n<img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-22301\" src=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/10\/seo-content-4-2.png\" alt=\"graphic showing post ranking in the finance industry\" width=\"1401\" height=\"738\" \/>\r\n\r\nNot all posts will earn the first placement on Google, but ranking on page one, in general, will still increase your organic traffic.\r\n\r\nLooking at the cybersecurity industry, the keyword \u201ccaptcha\u201d has a search volume of 50,000 and is very hard to rank for. The <a href=\"https:\/\/www.pandasecurity.com\/mediacenter\/panda-security\/what-is-captcha\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">post ranking number 6<\/a>, still drives 1,725 visits per month.\r\n\r\n<img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-22302\" src=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/10\/seo-content-5-2.png\" alt=\"graphic showing a cybersecurity post ranking\" width=\"1401\" height=\"742\" \/>\r\n\r\nSo as you can see, individual posts that rank on Google can greatly contribute to a site\u2019s overall organic traffic.\r\n<h3>Raises Brand Awareness<\/h3>\r\nBrand awareness is not easily measured but is a large contributor to a brand\u2019s success. If no one has heard of you, how do they know they need your product?\r\n\r\nCreating SEO content around your brand\u2019s product or service will help you increase your brand awareness. If your content is ranking on Google, more users are clicking on it and familiarizing themselves with your offering.\r\n\r\nThis brand awareness can be created by layering your content topics. For example, if you provide an apartment search resource, your content can target users before they even search \u201capartments for rent.\u201d By focusing on terms like \u201cnotice to vacate\u201d or \u201chow to get an apartment with bad credit\u201d you are layering content around your apartment search product page. People will reference your guides and earn your trust before they are ready to find a new apartment. Then when they begin their search, your brand will come to mind.\r\n<h3>Attracts Top and Middle-Funnel Customers<\/h3>\r\nIt\u2019s hard to have a marketing conversation without bringing up the funnel. And while tofu is not part of my diet, it has made it into my SEO strategy. In fact, <a href=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/strategy\/top-funnel-seo-content\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">top-funnel content can be more valuable<\/a> than the bottom-funnel topics you might have been focusing on.\r\n\r\nCreating content that targets broader terms can catch users in the awareness and consideration stage. This gives you an opportunity to guide them to a solution (hint: it\u2019s your product).\r\n<h3>Earns Passive Links<\/h3>\r\nYou want to work smarter not harder, right? Creating content that\u2019s optimized to rank can help you obtain passive links over time.\r\n\r\nIf Google thinks your content is good enough to rank, bloggers and reporters will think it\u2019s good enough to cite in their articles. Specific categories of SEO content that we\u2019ve seen do well at earning passive links are statistics posts, definitional posts, resource lists and cost calculators.\r\n\r\nFor example, the keyword \u201cstartup statistics\u201d only has a search volume of 100, but a website with a domain authority of 58 was able to have <a href=\"https:\/\/www.embroker.com\/blog\/startup-statistics\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">their post<\/a> rank #1 and earned 280 passive links.\r\n\r\n<img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-22303\" src=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/10\/seo-content-6-2.png\" alt=\"graphic showing a post that earned passive links\" width=\"1401\" height=\"844\" \/>\r\n\r\nAdding shareable assets to these ranking SEO posts will also increase your likelihood of obtaining these passive links.\r\n<h2>How to Write SEO Content<\/h2>\r\nSo you\u2019ve decided you want your content to rank on Google. Great! Join the club.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, there are many additional factors that will contribute to if you\u2019ll be able to get your post on page one. Your domain authority, site speed and site structure are among the many factors that will <a href=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/seo\/google-ranking-factors\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">impact your ranking<\/a>.\r\n\r\nWhile you might not have control over those elements, you do have the ability to write a solid piece of content. To help, here is a rundown of how to go about writing SEO content.\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/10\/seo-content-7.png\" alt=\"graphic showing the 5 steps for writing SEO content\" width=\"1400\" height=\"707\" \/>\r\n<h3>Step 1. Find a Keyword<\/h3>\r\nChoosing the right keyword to target is essential. You want to pick keywords that have a strong tie to your brand, have decent search volume, are low difficulty and have a search intent you can match with a blog post.\r\n\r\nKeyword research is a much larger topic that a whole blog post could be written on, but here are a few strategies for finding keywords:\r\n<ul>\r\n \t<li>Use <a href=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/creation\/content-marketing-tools\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">content marketing tools<\/a> to see what your competitors are doing. What topics do they cover? What are their top trafficked pages?<\/li>\r\n \t<li>Try using the <a href=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/seo\/topic-clusters\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">hub and spoke strategy<\/a>. Focus on long tail keywords that tie directly back to your product pages.<\/li>\r\n \t<li>Take a look at <a href=\"https:\/\/trends.google.com\/trends\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Google trends<\/a>. Is there anything trending in your industry that you can speak to?<\/li>\r\n \t<li>Use <a href=\"https:\/\/answerthepublic.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Answer the Public<\/a> to see what additional questions people are asking about your topic. Do any of them have search volume?<\/li>\r\n \t<li>Explore <a href=\"https:\/\/explodingtopics.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Exploding Topics<\/a> to see what topics have had a recent growth increase.<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n<h3>Step 2. Evaluate the SERP<\/h3>\r\nOnce you decide on a keyword you\u2019ll need to evaluate the SERP. The first thing to look for is search intent.\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/10\/seo-content-8.png\" alt=\"graphic showing the types of search intent\" width=\"1400\" height=\"632\" \/>\r\n\r\nSome types of search intent include:\r\n<ul>\r\n \t<li><strong>Informational intent<\/strong> \u2013 the user is searching the term to find information<\/li>\r\n \t<li><strong>Navigational intent<\/strong> \u2013 the user is looking for a specific result<\/li>\r\n \t<li><strong>Transactional intent<\/strong> \u2013 the user is looking to purchase something<\/li>\r\n \t<li><strong>Commercial investigation<\/strong> \u2013 the user is in the market for something but wants to compare options<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\nThe type of search intent will dictate whether you should proceed with the keyword or find a different one. SERPs that show navigational and transactional intent will likely require a product page to rank. It\u2019s best to stay away from them and focus on informational and commercial investigation searches.\r\n\r\nAnother consideration when analyzing the SERP is the types of websites that are able to rank.\r\n\r\nFor example, let\u2019s say you\u2019re a real estate brand that\u2019s interested in targeting \u201cbest neighborhoods in nyc\u201d which has a search volume of 1,600 and a difficulty of 10.\r\n\r\n<img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-22304\" src=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/10\/seo-content-9-2.png\" alt=\"graphic showing the top results\" width=\"1402\" height=\"866\" \/>\r\n\r\nLooking at the top results, you can see that you\u2019ll need a fairly high DA to rank. You\u2019ll also notice that it\u2019s mainly well-known news and travel sites ranking. As a real estate site, you\u2019ll have a hard time competing.\r\n<h3>Step 3. Outline the Post<\/h3>\r\nOnce you\u2019ve chosen a keyword and verified that you can compete with the current SERP, you\u2019ll want to outline the post. Outlining a post will help ensure you\u2019re including all the key SEO elements.\r\n\r\nFor more details on how to correctly structure a post outline, see my previous post on <a href=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/creation\/blog-post-templates\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">blog post templates<\/a>. It includes downloadable templates you can use to get started.\r\n\r\nThere are a number of SEO elements you\u2019ll want to include in your outline:\r\n<ul>\r\n \t<li>A list of your keyword and related keywords<\/li>\r\n \t<li>A blog post title that includes your keyword and will <a href=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/creation\/blog-title-examples\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">drive CTR<\/a><\/li>\r\n \t<li>H2\/H3 structuring that will help users find what they\u2019re looking for<\/li>\r\n \t<li><a href=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/marketing\/link-valuation\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Internal linking<\/a> to relevant product pages and related posts<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\nOutlining the post will help you naturally include these elements as you write. A well-structured post is also easier for the reader to follow.\r\n<h3>Step 4. Write Your Post<\/h3>\r\nAfter all that, you\u2019re finally ready to write the post.\r\n\r\nWhile you\u2019re writing, be sure to keep your audience in mind. The tone of your piece will depend on what your readers would want to hear. For instance, a post by a cybersecurity company will probably be more technical and direct while a perfume brand might use a more warm and playful tone.\r\n\r\nIn addition, you\u2019ll want to hold the reader\u2019s attention. Long pages of copy are difficult to read. Keep your paragraphs short (5 lines max) and use visuals to break up the copy.\r\n\r\nWhen <a href=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/seo\/seo-writing\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">writing your SEO content<\/a>, you\u2019ll want to make it as comprehensive as possible. Ensure you\u2019ve included everything your reader might want to know about the topic. Referencing the People Also Ask questions on Google can help you determine related queries that should be answered in your post. Maybe even try leveling it up with an <a href=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/creation\/animated-infographics\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">animated infographic<\/a> or video.\r\n\r\nCheck your spelling and grammar with tools like <a href=\"https:\/\/app.grammarly.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Grammarly<\/a> or <a href=\"http:\/\/www.hemingwayapp.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Hemingway<\/a>. Even the most experienced writers make mistakes.\r\n<h3>Step 5. Optimize for SEO<\/h3>\r\nWhen the post is written and the visuals are created, you\u2019ll be ready to upload to your CMS. WordPress is the most common but other popular options are Wix, Drupal, Squarespace and Weebly.\r\n\r\nWhen you upload, there are additional SEO elements to take into consideration:\r\n<ul>\r\n \t<li>Optimize your URL structure so it includes your keyword<\/li>\r\n \t<li>Include an <a href=\"https:\/\/yoast.com\/meta-descriptions\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">optimized meta description<\/a><\/li>\r\n \t<li>Choose a relevant category for your post<\/li>\r\n \t<li>Create alt text for any images<\/li>\r\n \t<li>Ensure all your links open in a new tab<\/li>\r\n \t<li>Use the Yoast plugin to help you optimize but don\u2019t feel obligated to get every post \u201cin the green\u201d \u2013 some requirements aren\u2019t necessary.<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n<strong>Download an SEO content checklist here:<\/strong>\r\n\r\n<a href=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/10\/siege-content-printable-clickable.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><img class=\"alignnone\" src=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/10\/seo-content-11-400x75.png\" alt=\"download PDF button\" width=\"400\" height=\"75\" \/><\/a>\r\n\r\n<a href=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/10\/SEO-Checklist.docx.zip\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-21970 size-medium\" src=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/10\/seo-content-10-400x75.png\" alt=\"download word doc button\" width=\"400\" height=\"75\" \/><\/a>\r\n<h3>Step 6. Track Your Results<\/h3>\r\nOnce your post is live, you can start to track your results. Keep in mind, with SEO you\u2019re playing the long game. Posts can take a few months to a year to start ranking.\r\n\r\nIf you continue to target attainable keywords and optimize for SEO, you should start to see an increase in traffic to your site, grow your brand awareness and gain passive links.\r\n<h2>Keep Learning<\/h2>\r\nThere you have it. The next time someone mentions SEO but their content doesn\u2019t follow this basic structure, you\u2019ll be able to call their bluff.\r\n\r\nLearning more about these content marketing topics can help you understand who knows what they\u2019re talking about and who is just regurgitating buzzwords.

    "content": "Is it possible to convert customers on a blog post?\r\n\r\nWhile it may not be realistic to expect an immediate \"click to add to cart\" conversion on your blog content, you can nudge readers further down your <a href=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/conversation\/bottom-funnel-links\">buyer's funnel<\/a>.\r\n\r\nThis week I share some of our favorite methods to convert your clients in a way that doesn't make them immediately want to bounce off the page.\r\n<div class=\"video-container\"><iframe src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/f3h3y5Npes4\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"><span data-mce-type=\"bookmark\" style=\"display: inline-block; width: 0px; overflow: hidden; line-height: 0;\" class=\"mce_SELRES_start\">\ufeff<\/span><\/iframe><\/div>\r\n[subscribe-cta bloglink1=TRUE text1=\"Subscribe to Content &amp; Links\"]\r\n<h2>Video Transcription<\/h2>\r\nWhen we get into the brainstorming stage and start creating a lot of <a href=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/strategy\/increase-website-traffic\">organic traffic<\/a> that could mean upwards of thousands, if not tens of thousands of visits to our client's blog month over month, just with a single piece of content.\r\n\r\nIt makes sense that once we get content ranking for our clients, we should start thinking about how we can convert those customers that are coming onto their blog content. It can be really hard to do this in an elegant and effective way. Based on our experience and what we've guided, some of our clients in the past, I'm going to share some of my top tips and features that I've seen around the web.\r\n\r\nI should note first that when I say <strong>conversions<\/strong>, I mean that in a pretty broad goal setting sense. A conversion for one client may be adding a product to a cart, but a conversion for another client may be downloading an eBook or requesting a demo. This is however you like to set goals and what your expectations are of what your blog content should be doing and how you can implement that in a professional and elegant looking way.\r\n<h2>Option 1: Banner Ads<\/h2>\r\nMy first tip is banner ads within content. This is a pretty obvious tip\u2014we see it a lot on content getting a good amount of traffic, then adding a banner ad either to the top of the fold middle of content, or at the very end. It's a great, low effort way to encourage click through rate and to encourage more engagement on content.\r\n\r\nBut I've also seen banner ads that are really poor and obtrusive or just ineffective. I wanted to point out some examples that I've seen that I really like and think are doing a really great job. One example is <a href=\"https:\/\/www.rei.com\/learn\/expert-advice\/trail-running-tips.html?series=intro-to-trail-running\">REI<\/a>.\r\n\r\n<img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-22225\" src=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/10\/REI-banner-ad.jpg\" alt=\"REI banner ad\" width=\"1400\" height=\"877\" \/>\r\n\r\nIt's not always super aggressive, which I appreciate from an eCommerce brand. They do a good job at having banner ads that are more lower touch points, lower friction, something like signing up for a class or learning more about a specific product. It's not immediately there to sell you and it's not screaming at you, \"You need to buy this product right now!\"\r\n\r\n<img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-22215\" src=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/10\/related-products.jpg\" alt=\"proflowers related products\" width=\"1400\" height=\"877\" \/>\r\n\r\nAnother one that I like is <a href=\"https:\/\/www.proflowers.com\/blog\/peace-lily-care\">ProFlowers<\/a>, which shows related products at the end of every single post that are very well customized to what that post content is. It's also just a nice placement.\r\n\r\nI find that if you don't want to disrupt your blog content with a ton of banner CTAs, because that can really encourage bounce rate and make a poor user user experience, just try doing a CTA or a banner at the very bottom.\r\n\r\nIt might not get you as many clicks, but you can A\/B test placement throughout the post. I find that the bottom is still effective for many clients.\r\n\r\n<img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-22216\" src=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/10\/nerd-wallet-banner-ad.jpg\" alt=\"NerdWallet ad\" width=\"1400\" height=\"877\" \/>\r\n\r\nAnother one is <a href=\"https:\/\/www.nerdwallet.com\/article\/finance\/raise-credit-score-fast\">NerdWallet<\/a>. Their banner ad is much higher up in the content, usually after the introduction, but I find that their banner ads are just really well designed, simple, branded and it's in line with their content in a way that is not super distracting. If you're going to do a banner ad within the content, NerdWallet is a good example of that.\r\n\r\n<img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-22217\" src=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/10\/build-a-grid-wall-CTA.jpg\" alt=\"Frame Bridge products\" width=\"1400\" height=\"877\" \/>\r\n\r\nMy final example is doing more of an aggressive product grid. I like <a href=\"https:\/\/www.framebridge.com\/blog\/five-easy-ways-to-design-a-gallery-wall\">Frame Bridges'<\/a> example where it's nicely branded and simplified and feels a little bit more seamless within their blog content. Again, it's not very distracting.\r\n\r\nThat shows you the progression from Proflowers to NerdWallet to Frame Bridge of how you can incorporate a product banner ad more and more aggressively in your content.\r\n<h2>Option 2: Sidebar CTAs<\/h2>\r\nMy next tip for incorporating and encouraging CTAs on your blog content is utilizing your sidebar. My colleague Barbara, our senior front end developer did a great blog posts on just <a href=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/seo\/create-sidebars-help-seo\">sidebar best practices<\/a>, which goes over how you can effectively utilize your sidebar for conversions.\r\n\r\nI find that a lot of blog sidebars are an afterthought in blog design and UX, when really that is ideal real estate for conversions and encouraging a deeper click through rate in your content.\r\n\r\nI also see that brands make a mistake of busying it up with just way too many options. You should ideally just simplify it to two to three actions, maybe even just one banner ad to test out at first.\r\n\r\nThings that you can do to utilize conversion the sidebar is obviously banner ads. I like this example from <a href=\"https:\/\/www.usa.edu\/blog\/evidence-based-practice\/\">University of St. Augustine<\/a>. It shows max three options and very simplified. They clearly swap out these banners based on where they are in the semester and to encourage students to learn more.\r\n\r\n<img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-22218\" src=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/10\/medical-article-sidebar.jpg\" alt=\"sidebar for USAHS\" width=\"1400\" height=\"877\" \/>\r\n\r\nThis is a good example of how you can just create a nice clean sidebar, negate all the unnecessary stuff like an archive tab. You can do related posts in the sidebar, but maybe you want to put it elsewhere so not be so distracting. Maybe even remove social media buttons from that place in the sidebar to really draw attention.\r\n\r\nAnother smart thing is just to have the sidebar scroll with the user as they continue to read content. It's nice reminder CTA to the right hand side, as they continue to scroll down the page.\r\n<h2>Option 3: Pop ups<\/h2>\r\nMy next tip is popups and interstitials. These get a lot of people upset in the content world because we've all experienced bad popups. They can be really obtrusive, poorly designed. They can slow down load speeds.\r\n\r\nPop ups get a really bad rap of just being a negative UX experience. But again, there are smart ways to use a popup and not have it hurt your UX and also not have it hurt your SEO do keep in mind that Google has released rules about interstitials and what are best practices to ensure that you're not getting penalized from a traffic perspective.\r\n\r\nSome brands whose popups I do enjoy, the first one is <a href=\"https:\/\/www.policygenius.com\/life-insurance\/cost-of-cremation\/\">PolicyGenius<\/a>. Their pop-up is very small, towards the bottom of the page, that comes up when you're on their content. Something that I really love about their popup is that the copy will change in that popup based on the page that you're on.\r\n\r\n<img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-22219\" src=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/10\/policy-recommendations-CTA.jpg\" alt=\"PolicyGenius banner ad\" width=\"1400\" height=\"877\" \/>\r\n\r\nIf I'm clicking through to different pages and I keep getting the same pop-up and it's copy and paste the same copy across each one. That to me just expresses laziness and it doesn't make me want to click. I'm more inclined to just tune it out.\r\n\r\nAnother one that I like is on <a href=\"https:\/\/www.braze.com\/perspectives\/article\/humanized-marketing\">Braze<\/a>. They have a nice pop-up banner that's well-branded and appears as you start scrolling at the bottom of the page.\r\n\r\n<img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-22220\" src=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/10\/braze-banner-ad.jpg\" alt=\"Braze banner ad\" width=\"1400\" height=\"877\" \/>\r\n\r\nIn terms of full page popups, definitely follow Google's guidelines on what they consider obtrusive versus unobtrusive. Make sure that if you want to introduce some full page popup, you're not doing so at risk of getting a penalty or losing traffic.\r\n\r\nSometimes full page popups on blog content is a little strange and too aggressive because if we think about the buyer's funnel, a lot of blog content is at that top of the funnel. Popups, especially a full page, is encouraging a lot of bounce rate and a poor reader experience.\r\n<h2>Option 4: Get Creative!<\/h2>\r\nThese are other creative ideas that I've seen around the web that don't really fit in the three categories I just mentioned.\r\n\r\nTalking again about Braze, they have a little \"Connect with Sales\" text at the bottom right hand of a lot of their pages, which I thought was just like a nice, subtle nudge to encourage somebody to set up a demo with them.\r\n\r\nIt's not the best because as you scroll, it will collide with other content on the page and become hard to read. With a little bit of tweaking they're almost there.\r\n\r\nThe next one is considering having your content be the call to action. The obvious thing is to internally link to service pages, you should default be doing that. But to take it a step further, I love this example from <a href=\"https:\/\/www.embroker.com\/blog\/coverage-quiz\/\">Embroker<\/a> where they do a insurance policy quiz. They actually quiz the user on what do you know about your insurance policy and find out knowledge gaps for their customers, and then encourage reading more below based on the answers they got wrong.\r\n\r\n<img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-22221\" src=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/10\/embroker-quiz.jpg\" alt=\"Embroker quiz\" width=\"1400\" height=\"877\" \/>\r\n\r\nYou're basically building a piece of content that in effect is doing the converting for you. And it's again, is convincing that customer to educate themselves a little bit and then reach out if they are interested in learning more.\r\n\r\nAnother one that I've seen, especially in eCommerce and like home and lifestyle brands is the clickable product images. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.potterybarn.com\/tips-and-ideas\/how-to-create-a-gallery-wall\/\">Pottery Barn<\/a> does a great example of this, where you'll see a really nice styled kitchen or dining room image. And then the little \"+\" symbols that hover over certain products that are in that image. You can just click on them to open up a more detailed product description, easily add to cart.\r\n\r\n<img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-22222\" src=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/10\/how-to-hang-a-gallery-wall.jpg\" alt=\"Pottery Barn product photos\" width=\"1400\" height=\"877\" \/>\r\n\r\nThere's a little bit of UX and <a href=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/conversation\/designers-marketers-collaborate\">design tweaking<\/a> that Pottery Barn could do to make that pop up a little bit more pleasing to the eye, but it's really smart from a conversion perspective to add that sort of feature on your blog content.\r\n\r\nFinally, I really like going back to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.nerdwallet.com\/article\/finance\/raise-credit-score-fast\">NerdWallet<\/a> in addition to the banner ads that they have in content, they also have a deeper CTA that is more of a question answer format.\r\n\r\n<img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-22223\" src=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/10\/credit-report-quiz.jpg\" alt=\"NerdWallet in content questions\" width=\"1400\" height=\"877\" \/>\r\n\r\nIf you're on a blog post and you're trying to learn more about a specific topic, there will be a box that asks you a question with multiple choice answers. Based on what you select, it will say \"Get a quote\" or \"Learn more\" as an option.\r\n\r\nThat's a great way to get <a href=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/creation\/types-of-content-marketing\">people engaging<\/a> with the content a little bit more, make sure that they're reading what you're actually writing and bring them further down the funnel."

    "content": "You\u2019ve worked hard to craft the perfect piece. You\u2019re excited, confident that your client will love it. It\u2019s going to be immaculate once the design is done and everything gets published, it just has to go through your editor first.\r\n\r\nFast forward a few days \u2014 your piece is back from the editor, and whoa, it\u2019s filled with line edits and copious comments in the margins. Not to mention, there\u2019s an email or comment in the project thread outlining their suggestions.\r\n\r\nYour first thought may be, \u201cYikes, I didn\u2019t think it was that bad,\u201d but trust me, your editor doesn\u2019t think that either. They\u2019re on team Great Content right along with you and they just want to help make this piece be the best it can be.\r\n\r\nWe\u2019ll focus on content editing, the mother of all editing strategies and one of the best tools for creating exquisite content. We\u2019ll also cover how it compares to other editing styles, why it matters and my process for editing content.\r\n<h2>What Is Content Editing?<\/h2>\r\n<strong>Content editing is an editing style that takes a comprehensive look at content<\/strong> \u2014 from big picture concepts and content architecture to smaller elements like sentence structure, syntax and punctuation \u2014 with the ultimate goal of crafting the most impactful piece possible. It includes the basics of copy editing and takes them a step further to include brand voice, adherence to a client's style guide and even strategic decisions about information design and delivery. Content editing encompasses the importance of all editing styles and turns them up a notch.\r\n\r\nExample: Say you\u2019ve written a long-form guide on \u201chow to make a bouquet\u201d for a wedding industry client. It\u2019s a straightforward keyword that gives you plenty of room to outline a step-by-step process, plus it has a search volume of 600 and a keyword difficulty of 11. Not too bad, right?\r\n\r\n<img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-22024\" src=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/10\/content-editing.png\" alt=\"Content editing definition.\" width=\"1400\" height=\"550\" \/>\r\n\r\nAny editor you work with will check your spelling, grammar and punctuation \u2014 those are the basics. But if you work with a <em>content<\/em> editor, they\u2019ll also check your strategy, evaluating the strength of each sentence and paragraph to ensure your piece delivers what the reader needs in the most efficient, effective way possible.\r\n\r\nThey may even suggest pivoting your keyword to \u201chow to make a wedding bouquet,\u201d which has a search volume of 800 and a keyword difficulty of 8.\r\n\r\nSome of the questions they\u2019ll look to answer while editing include:\r\n<ul>\r\n \t<li>Will readers actually learn how to make a bouquet?<\/li>\r\n \t<li>Are the tips and tricks useful, actionable and digestible? Bonus points: Are they easily shareable?<\/li>\r\n \t<li>Is the order of steps logical and are the guidelines easy to understand? Would it make sense to rearrange anything?<\/li>\r\n \t<li>Are there any sections that could use more elaboration? Less fluff?<\/li>\r\n \t<li>Do the visuals fit well with the copy? Should anything be tweaked?<\/li>\r\n \t<li>Are there any obvious keyword pivots or ways to make it more <a href=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/marketing\/diversity-equity-inclusion\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">accessible to readers<\/a> while still satisfying ranking needs?<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\nContent edits can be anything from basic punctuation fixes and in-post suggestions to comments in the margins. Suggestions can include tweaking ideas (\u201cmaybe try wording this concept as XYZ\u201d), adjusting the flow (\u201cthis paragraph\/idea\/section may work better under its own header because of ABC\u201d) and offering clarifications (\u201cthis is confusing, can you simplify\/reword\/elaborate?\u201d).\r\n\r\nYour editor is your crash test reader. They're a fresh set of eyes with plenty of perspective on <a href=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/conversation\/content-strategy-lessons\">content strategy<\/a>: It\u2019s a great opportunity to button things up, from the tiny wording missteps to the bigger ideas that could use some extra love.\r\n\r\nAs a writer, you may be thinking, \u201cAren\u2019t all editing strategies the same? Aren\u2019t they all here to fix my mistakes, make me sound smarter and make the client sound good?\u201d In the simplest terms, sure.\r\n\r\nEditors, no matter their official title, are here to help brush up your content and give it a polish, from adding in a missing comma to streamlining that clunky paragraph. Let\u2019s see how all the different types of editing overlap and stand out.\r\n<h2>Types of Editing<\/h2>\r\nYou\u2019ve probably heard about various types of editing, especially if you\u2019ve worked in PR, publishing or marketing for some time. Some common types of editing include:\r\n\r\n\u2192 <strong>Proofreading.<\/strong> Get out your red pen \u2014 this is typically the last stage of editing before publishing for last-minute grammar, spelling and punctuation fixes. If you can never remember if it\u2019s \u201ccompliment\u201d or \u201ccomplement,\u201d your proofreader has your back.\r\n\r\n\u2192 <strong>Fact-checking.<\/strong> This important job focuses on ensuring all facts in the piece are correct, like dates, citations and references. Nothing tanks the credibility of your piece faster than a misattributed quote or incorrectly cited study.\r\n\r\n\u2192 <strong>Line editing.<\/strong> Most commonly used in book editing, a line editor goes line by line and analyzes every last detail, with the ultimate goal of tightening everything up for the final publication. They analyze things such as word choice, sentence length and meaning, and may offer more nitpicky suggestions like, \u201ca semicolon would be more impactful than an em dash here.\u201d\r\n\r\nBut what about copy editing? Let\u2019s go over the differences and similarities between copy editing and content editing.\r\n<h3>Content Editing vs. Copy Editing<\/h3>\r\nAs mentioned, content editing focuses on creating comprehensive and productive content that\u2019s useful to the reader, optimized for the web and satisfying to the client.\r\n\r\nSo a content editor evaluates the overall structure and quality as well as sentence composition, quality sourcing, intuitive flow of ideas and adherence to brand voice and style \u2014 all while keeping an eye on copy basics like spelling, punctuation and grammar.\r\n\r\nCopy editing, on the other hand, just focuses on the copy itself. Spelling, grammar, punctuation \u2014 the basics. A copy editor isn\u2019t there to question the argument of your piece or make higher level suggestions; it\u2019s assumed that the overall structure of the piece is already pretty solid.\r\n\r\nThey\u2019ll also check the design, title, meta, author bio and other details of the piece to make sure everything is buttoned up, but only in terms of typos and mistakes.\r\n<table class=\"table table-bordered\" style=\"width: 100%;\">\r\n<thead style=\"color: #fff; background: #FF0000;\">\r\n<tr>\r\n<th><\/th>\r\n<th>Content Editor<\/th>\r\n<th>Copy Editor<\/th>\r\n<th>Proofreader<\/th>\r\n<th>Fact Checker<\/th>\r\n<\/tr>\r\n<\/thead>\r\n<tbody>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td>Checks grammar, spelling, punctuation, syntax, etc. (in both copy and design)<\/td>\r\n<td>\u2713<\/td>\r\n<td>\u2713<\/td>\r\n<td>\u2713<\/td>\r\n<td><\/td>\r\n<\/tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td>Edits with the audience in mind<\/td>\r\n<td>\u2713<\/td>\r\n<td>\u2713<\/td>\r\n<td><\/td>\r\n<td><\/td>\r\n<\/tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td>Edits for readability<\/td>\r\n<td>\u2713<\/td>\r\n<td>\u2713<\/td>\r\n<td><\/td>\r\n<td><\/td>\r\n<\/tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td>Edits according to style guide, brand voice, tone, etc.<\/td>\r\n<td>\u2713<\/td>\r\n<td>\u2713<\/td>\r\n<td><\/td>\r\n<td><\/td>\r\n<\/tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td>Verifies citations, quotations, accuracy of the copy, etc.<\/td>\r\n<td>\u2713<\/td>\r\n<td><\/td>\r\n<td><\/td>\r\n<td>\u2713<\/td>\r\n<\/tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td>Offers SEO feedback<\/td>\r\n<td>\u2713<\/td>\r\n<td><\/td>\r\n<td><\/td>\r\n<td><\/td>\r\n<\/tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td>Applies content marketing strategy best practices to evaluate content quality and effectiveness<\/td>\r\n<td>\u2713<\/td>\r\n<td><\/td>\r\n<td><\/td>\r\n<td><\/td>\r\n<\/tr>\r\n<\/tbody>\r\n<\/table>\r\n<h2>Why Is Content Editing Important?<\/h2>\r\nContent editing is crucial to ensure your piece is effective, digestible and fun to read. It's also critical to ensuring client satisfaction and performance results. It should go without saying, but in order to be a strong content editor, you also need to be a solid copy editor and fact checker.\r\n\r\n<strong>In <a href=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/courses\/content-marketing\">content marketing<\/a>, it\u2019s important to cover all your bases, and content editing can do that for whatever you\u2019re writing \u2014 it ensures that all elements are addressed.<\/strong>\r\n\r\nLet\u2019s go back to that example about how to create a bouquet. If the article is riddled with spelling errors and missing punctuation, and doesn't teach you how to make a bouquet, that takes away from the core of the piece and surely won't make your client happy.\r\n\r\nIt definitely won't help a reader out either. A content editor wears multiple hats to help bring together all the loose ends of a piece and take it to the next level.\r\n<h2>My Editing Process<\/h2>\r\nFirst thing\u2019s first: Caffeine. Just as you probably write better when you\u2019re wide awake, I\u2019ll definitely do a better job of editing with a mug close by.\r\n\r\nOnce that\u2019s settled, it\u2019s editing time. My overall editing process has the same key components for every project, but there are a few considerations and adjustments I make on a case-by-case basis, which I\u2019ll cover below.\r\n\r\nBe sure to check out our <a href=\"#printable checklist\">printable checklist<\/a> to help you get the most out of your content edits.\r\n\r\n<img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-22023\" src=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/10\/content-editing-workflow-animation.gif\" alt=\"Content editing workflow.\" width=\"1400\" height=\"481\" \/>\r\n<h3>Step 1: What Am I Working With?<\/h3>\r\nBefore getting started, I take stock of what I\u2019m editing. Is it a short <a href=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/conversation\/seo-content-neville-medhora\">SEO post<\/a> focused on ranking for a particular keyword? Is it a long-form guide with an <a href=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/creation\/animated-infographics\">infographic<\/a>? Are we showcasing proprietary survey findings?\r\n\r\nThis helps me understand what to expect and keep an eye out for. I also take note of the word count. While the amount of time it takes me to edit a piece depends a lot on things like the subject matter, style guide and writer, I can usually edit 1,000 words in half an hour or less.\r\n\r\nBack to our bouquet piece: I want to be sure that the \u201chow to\u201d aspect is achieved \u2014 if I still can\u2019t answer the question, \u201chow do I make my own wedding bouquet?\u201d by the outro, that\u2019ll be my number one point of feedback. Having a general idea of what I\u2019m editing at the start makes for more effective content editing than jumping in blind.\r\n<h3>Step 2: Style Check<\/h3>\r\nNext, I note which client I\u2019m editing for. As a <a href=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/conversation\/seo-lessons\">content marketing agency<\/a>, we have a wide array of clients \u2014 from lifestyle and wedding to finance and insurance agencies \u2014 and they each have their own unique voice, branding and style guidelines.\r\n\r\nSome clients opt for the classic AP style, while others provide us with their own in-house guidelines. I\u2019ve seen 15-page style guides come across my desk before, with preferences on everything such as number usage and their preferred sentence length.\r\n\r\nHefty style guide or not, I always take time to get my head in the zone for that client. If they have a long style guide, I review everything, even if I\u2019ve worked with them before. I\u2019ll also note specific preferences and keep an eye out for those once I start.\r\n\r\nSimilarly, if a client is new to the agency or new to me, I take extra time to get familiar with their guidelines. I\u2019m also a huge fan of using sticky notes to remind myself of a client\u2019s preferences.\r\n<h3>Step 3: Dive Into Edits<\/h3>\r\nArmed with a style guide and an idea of what I\u2019ll be reading, I start editing. Typically, I\u2019ll do a quick sweep of the piece to get a feel for everything, keeping an eye out for:\r\n<ul>\r\n \t<li>Glaring, obvious errors right off the bat<\/li>\r\n \t<li>The length of the piece and the number of design elements<\/li>\r\n \t<li>Correctly and consistently formatted headers<\/li>\r\n \t<li>Readability of text (i.e., are there large blocks of text that could be broken up with bulleted lists, design elements, etc.?)<\/li>\r\n \t<li>The main editorial considerations of the client (for example, do they love the Oxford comma or only want headers to be formatted in sentence case?)<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\nOnce that\u2019s taken care of, I\u2019ll do a more focused edit. Some sections get an extra read or two to make sure they really fit. I frequently make notes for myself to come back to \u2014 sometimes a section takes a couple of reads in the context of the whole piece before I can provide constructive feedback.\r\n\r\nIf a piece needs some extra love in terms of writing quality, I\u2019ll often take care of those edits first and then do an additional read to address the overall structure and comprehensiveness of the piece.\r\n\r\nI often have to decide how picky to be. While I will make sure you\u2019ve used a semicolon correctly, I won\u2019t spend my editing time deciding whether an em dash would be more impactful in that one particular sentence. It\u2019s all about balance and keeping the ultimate goal of the piece in mind.\r\n<h3>Step 4: Take a Break<\/h3>\r\nAs an editor, it\u2019s important not to get burned out. If I'm working with a long piece, a client that has a complex style guide or a particularly complicated (or boring \u2014 we've all been there) subject, the last thing I need is to be rushed or feel like my editing skills are dwindling.\r\n\r\nI often take a breather before finishing edits \u2014 get that second cup of coffee, answer emails for 20 minutes, take a stretch break, whatever helps me refresh. Coming back with fresh eyes does me a lot of good, not to mention, it benefits the finished product and my feedback for the writer.\r\n<h3>Step 5: Summarize<\/h3>\r\nOnce I finish edits, whether I needed a break or it was smooth sailing, I take a quick look back at my work. If a piece warranted a lot of edits and comments, I\u2019ll do my best to distill everything into a high-level look at my edits for the writer.\r\n\r\nI\u2019m also a writer and know it can be stressful to get a piece back covered in tracked changes \u2014 being able to send a few bullet points to the author summarizing my notes is the least I can do to help a piece be successful. I also make myself available to talk through any edits or particular sections. Every writer can use an extra set of eyes and a sounding board to perfect their work.\r\n<h2>Content Editing Is Your Best Friend<\/h2>\r\nContent editing is an integral part of writing a good <a href=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/creation\/blog-post-templates\">blog post<\/a> and crafting an effective content marketing strategy. While it may look a little different for each piece you write, it helps reinforce your writing and make it work even harder. And don\u2019t stress too much if it feels like your editor is shredding your work. Take it from me: Your editor is your number one cheerleader.\r\n<a id=\"printable checklist\"><\/a>\r\nNeed more content editing inspiration?

    "content": "Google search operators are a vital part of every step of our process \u2014 from brainstorming and content creation all the way through outreach.\r\n\r\nIt's a powerful tool used by our <a href=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/creation\/content-creator\">content marketing specialists<\/a> to sift through endless digital clutter, finding relevant ideas and receptive audiences for our clients\u2019 content.\r\n\r\nSimply put, Google search operators consist of one or more characters used in search that add more specificity and focus to a query.\r\n\r\nWithout these parameters, Google pulls a broad swath of what it thinks are relevant pages \u2014 but you may only be interested in anchor text containing \u201cguide\u201d on pages with \u201cresources\u201d in the URL and \u201cparents\u201d in the title. Enter: search operators.\r\n\r\nEducation is key (it\u2019s why we created <a href=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/courses\/content-marketing\">45 lessons on content marketing<\/a>) \u2014 so we\u2019re the first to admit that a tool is only as useful as the marketer wielding it. That\u2019s why it\u2019s important to brush up on all the actionable ways you can use Google search operators to level up your brainstorming, content creation and link building campaigns.\r\n<h2>14 Basic Operators To Get You Started<\/h2>\r\nIf you\u2019re new to search operators, you\u2019ll first want to get familiar with the basic building blocks. The following 14 operators search sites, URLs, titles, in-post text and more. They can be used alone or in combination with each other.\r\n<h3>1. site:URL [input]<\/h3>\r\nSometimes search functions within sites themselves aren\u2019t great. Reddit is notorious for having a bad search engine. If you\u2019re interested in pulling up all related pages on a site for a specific keyword or topic, your best bet is to use site:URL [input].\r\n\r\nExample \u2192 <a href=\"https:\/\/www.google.com\/search?q=site%3Asiegemedia.com+%E2%80%9Clink+building%E2%80%9D&amp;oq=site%3Asiegemedia.com+%E2%80%9Clink+building%E2%80%9D&amp;aqs=chrome..69i57j69i58.253j0j4&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8\">site:siegemedia.com \u201clink building\u201d<\/a>\r\n<h3>2. related:URL<\/h3>\r\nYou just found the perfect prospect for a link building campaign. You think, there have to be other sites out there just like this one. Related:URL helps you find sites in the same niche.\r\n\r\nExample \u2192 <a href=\"https:\/\/www.google.com\/search?q=related%3Anerdwallet.com&amp;oq=related%3Anerdwallet.com&amp;aqs=chrome..69i57j69i58.253j0j7&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8\">related:nerdwallet.com<\/a>\r\n<h3>3. cache:URL<\/h3>\r\nTo locate Google\u2019s cached version of a site, use cache:URL. This will give you an idea of when the page was last crawled by Google, if your site is being indexed, and if updates to your site have been cached.\r\n\r\nExample \u2192 <a href=\"http:\/\/webcache.googleusercontent.com\/search?q=cache%3Acontainerstore.com&amp;oq=cache%3Acontainerstore.com&amp;aqs=chrome..69i57j69i58.2623j0j4&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8\">cache:containerstore.com<\/a>\r\n<h3>4. inurl:[input]<\/h3>\r\nUse this operator when you want to pull sites with a specific word in the URL. This is useful if you\u2019re looking for sites within a specific niche or if you want to pull up certain subfolders.\r\n\r\nExample \u2192 <a href=\"https:\/\/www.google.com\/search?q=Pampers+inurl%3Apregnancy&amp;oq=Pampers+inurl%3Apregnancy&amp;aqs=chrome..69i57.221j0j4&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8\">Pampers inurl:pregnancy<\/a>\r\n<h3>5. intitle:[input]<\/h3>\r\nMaybe you only want to locate pages with a specific title, like resource pages or about pages. Use intitle to specify which words you want to see in page titles.\r\n\r\nExample \u2192 <a href=\"https:\/\/www.google.com\/search?q=Earnest+Loans+intitle%3A%E2%80%9Cstudent+loans%E2%80%9D&amp;oq=Earnest+Loans+intitle%3A%E2%80%9Cstudent+loans%E2%80%9D&amp;aqs=chrome..69i57.286j0j7&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8\">Earnest Loans intitle:\u201cstudent loans\u201d<\/a>\r\n\r\n<img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-21927\" src=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/10\/allintitle-allinurl-1.png\" alt=\"allintitle search operator\" width=\"1401\" height=\"633\" \/>\r\n<h3>6. intext:[input]<\/h3>\r\nJust like intitle, intext lets you locate specific text. This is particularly helpful for locating exact copies of text to find plagiarism, quotes or other specific copy.\r\n\r\nExample \u2192 <a href=\"https:\/\/www.google.com\/search?q=Goldfish+intext%3A%E2%80%9Cthe+snack+that+smiles+back%E2%80%9D&amp;oq=Goldfish+intext%3A%E2%80%9Cthe+snack+that+smiles+back%E2%80%9D&amp;aqs=chrome..69i57.254j0j9&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8\">Goldfish intext:\u201cthe snack that smiles back\u201d<\/a>\r\n<h3>7. inanchor:[input]<\/h3>\r\nUse inanchor to locate specific keywords within anchor text. This can help you locate \u201ccontact\u201d or \u201cabout us\u201d pages. It can also help you locate keyword competitors by searching an important keyword for your business and seeing who else is creating internal links to their site for that keyword.\r\n\r\nExample \u2192 <a href=\"https:\/\/www.google.com\/search?ei=-3x7X9H0EaKZ_QaOz6jABA&amp;q=inanchor%3A%E2%80%9Dcontent+marketing%E2%80%9D&amp;oq=inanchor%3A%E2%80%9Dcontent+marketing%E2%80%9D&amp;gs_lcp=CgZwc3ktYWIQAzoECAAQR1DVb1jVb2C7cGgAcAR4AIABVogBVpIBATGYAQCgAQKgAQGqAQdnd3Mtd2l6yAEIwAEB&amp;sclient=psy-ab&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiR3sW-oJ7sAhWiTN8KHY4nCkgQ4dUDCA0&amp;uact=5\">inanchor:\u201ccontent marketing\u201d<\/a>\r\n<h3>8. define:[input]<\/h3>\r\nThis is Google\u2019s built-in dictionary feature. Use it to retrieve a dictionary-style SERP feature for a word or phrase \u2014 quotation marks not required for multiple word queries.\r\n\r\nExample \u2192 <a href=\"https:\/\/www.google.com\/search?q=define%3Asearch+engine&amp;oq=define%3Asearch+engine&amp;aqs=chrome..69i57j69i58.453j0j9&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8\">define:search engine<\/a>\r\n<h3>9. [input] filetype:[input]<\/h3>\r\nIf you want to locate a specific file type such as a PDF or CSV, use the filetype operator. It\u2019s interchangeable with \u201cext:\u201d as well.\r\n\r\nExample \u2192 <a href=\"https:\/\/www.google.com\/search?q=census+data+filetype%3Acsv&amp;oq=census+data+filetype%3Acsv&amp;aqs=chrome..69i57.229j0j9&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8\">census data filetype:csv<\/a>\r\n<h3>10. \u201c[input]\u201d<\/h3>\r\nIf you want Google to pull the exact text you enter, word-for-word, be sure to include quotation marks around your query.\r\n\r\nExample \u2192 <a href=\"https:\/\/www.google.com\/search?q=%22how+to+increase+website+traffic+by+250k%2B+monthly+visits%22&amp;oq=%22how+to+increase+website+traffic+by+250k%2B+monthly+visits%22&amp;aqs=chrome..69i57j33l4.223j0j4&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8\">\"how to increase website traffic by 250k+ monthly visits\"<\/a>\r\n<h3>11. -[input]<\/h3>\r\nSometimes you want to exclude certain words from a broader content bucket. Use the \u201c-\u201d operator to ensure you\u2019re pulling results with all the words you want \u2014 and none that you don\u2019t.\r\n\r\nExample \u2192 <a href=\"https:\/\/www.google.com\/search?q=%E2%80%9Cwhite+hat+SEO%E2%80%9D+-%E2%80%9Dblack+hat+SEO%E2%80%9D&amp;oq=%E2%80%9Cwhite+hat+SEO%E2%80%9D+-%E2%80%9Dblack+hat+SEO%E2%80%9D&amp;aqs=chrome..69i57.1258j0j9&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8\">\u201cwhite hat SEO\u201d -\u201dblack hat SEO\u201d<\/a>\r\n<h3>12. [input] OR [input]<\/h3>\r\nThis allows you to search for two queries at once. Google will pull all results related to one or both of the keywords. Alternatively, use the pipe symbol: [input] | [input].\r\n\r\nExample \u2192 <a href=\"https:\/\/www.google.com\/search?q=%E2%80%9Cremote+work%E2%80%9D+OR+%E2%80%9Cin+office%E2%80%9D&amp;oq=%E2%80%9Cremote+work%E2%80%9D+OR+%E2%80%9Cin+office%E2%80%9D&amp;aqs=chrome..69i57j33l2.1314j0j9&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8\">\u201cremote work\u201d OR \u201cin office\u201d<\/a>\r\n<h3>13. [input] *<\/h3>\r\nWhat\u2019s life without a little chaos? The wildcard operator, represented by an asterisk, pulls up multiple variations of your query. The example below pulls up a SERP referencing the benefits of SEO for attorneys, small business, eCommerce and more. This can help you fill knowledge gaps or spark brainstorm inspiration.\r\n\r\nExample \u2192 <a href=\"https:\/\/www.google.com\/search?q=benefits+of+SEO+for+*&amp;oq=benefits+of+SEO+for+*&amp;aqs=chrome..69i57j0l7.841j0j9&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8\">benefits of SEO for *<\/a>\r\n<h3>14. AROUND (#)<\/h3>\r\nThe AROUND search, also referred to as the proximity search, will find pages with two keywords within a specified amount of words of each other. The example below would pull pages where \u201ccontent\u201d and \u201cmarketing\u201d are within three words of each other.\r\n\r\nExample \u2192 <a href=\"https:\/\/www.google.com\/search?q=content+AROUND+(3)+marketing&amp;oq=content+AROUND+(3)+marketing&amp;aqs=chrome..69i57j69i64.1179j0j9&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8\">content AROUND (3) marketing<\/a>\r\n<h2>25 Search Operators for Link Building<\/h2>\r\nOnce you\u2019re familiar with the functional purpose of each search operator, it\u2019s time to put them to practical use. Here are 25 practical uses for operators and why you should be using them to level up your search game. We\u2019ve broken them down by use below:\r\n<ul>\r\n \t<li><a href=\"#shareable\">Promoting shareable assets<\/a><\/li>\r\n \t<li><a href=\"#news\">Pitching high-end news<\/a><\/li>\r\n \t<li><a href=\"#blb\">Conducting broken link building<\/a><\/li>\r\n \t<li><a href=\"#reclamation\">Searching for link reclamation opportunities<\/a><\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n<a name=\"shareable\"><\/a>\r\n<h2>Promoting Shareable Assets<\/h2>\r\nWhen the content you\u2019re pitching in outreach features a shareable asset \u2014 infographic, printable or otherwise \u2014 you\u2019ll have the most luck with bloggers. These operators help you pinpoint blogs within your industry while driving qualified traffic to your site and signaling to Google that the <a href=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/marketing\/link-relevancy\">links are relevant<\/a> and valuable.\r\n<h3>1. site:URL intitle:[input]<\/h3>\r\nPerforming a site search with intitle can help you find tangentially related content on a site you want to pitch\u2014from infographics to printables and mood boards\u2014which can then be referenced in your personalized email.\r\n\r\nExample \u2192 <a href=\"https:\/\/www.google.com\/search?q=site%3Asiegemedia.com+intitle%3Atop-funnel&amp;oq=site%3Asiegemedia.com+intitle%3Atop-funnel&amp;aqs=chrome..69i57j69i58.211j0j9&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8\">site:siegemedia.com intitle:top-funnel<\/a>\r\n<h3>2. [buzzword] vs. *<\/h3>\r\nIf you\u2019re searching for content around a new buzzword or trending topic, you may be unfamiliar with tangentially-related concepts. Searching your term in conjunction with the wildcard asterisk will allow you to see what the trend is being compared with, which will inform additional search strings or even future content ideas.\r\n\r\nExample \u2192 <a href=\"https:\/\/www.google.com\/search?q=Microlearning+vs.+*&amp;oq=Microlearning+vs.+*&amp;aqs=chrome..69i57j0l4.853j0j9&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8\">Microlearning vs. *<\/a>\r\n<h3>3. [input] inurl:infographic<\/h3>\r\nIf you\u2019re <a href=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/creation\/why-and-how-infographics-work\">pitching an infographic<\/a> in outreach, you\u2019ll need to find other sites that share infographics from outside sources. Use inurl:infographic to find them. Your input can be as broad as your client\u2019s industry (health, decor, etc.) or as niche as a specific trend or buzzword (ikigai, kakeibo, etc.).\r\n\r\nVariations:\r\n<ul>\r\n \t<li>[input] intitle:infographic<\/li>\r\n \t<li>[input] intitle:infographic inurl:infographic<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\nExample \u2192 <a href=\"https:\/\/www.google.com\/search?q=workplace+productivity+intitle%3Ainfographic+inurl%3Ainfographic&amp;oq=workplace+productivity+intitle%3Ainfographic+inurl%3Ainfographic&amp;aqs=chrome..69i57.200j0j9&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8\">workplace productivity intitle:infographic inurl:infographic<\/a>\r\n<h3>4. [input] -pinterest<\/h3>\r\nWhen you\u2019re searching for a lifestyle-related query (often related to printables and activities), Pinterest pages will dominate the results. Since you\u2019ll want to locate the original source rather than a pin, it\u2019s best to filter these out.\r\n\r\nExample \u2192 <a href=\"https:\/\/www.google.com\/search?q=bachelorette+party+themes+-pinterest&amp;oq=bachelorette+party+themes+-pinterest&amp;aqs=chrome..69i57.222j0j9&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8\">bachelorette party themes -pinterest<\/a>\r\n<h3>5. [input] inurl:printables<\/h3>\r\nSimilarly to infographics, inurl:printables will help you find sites that share printables from outside sources. Since these results skew more lifestyle-related, it\u2019s best to accompany this with \u201c-pinterest.\u201d\r\n\r\nVariations:\r\n<ul>\r\n \t<li>[input] intitle:printables<\/li>\r\n \t<li>[input] intitle:printables inurl:printables<\/li>\r\n \t<li>[input] printable *<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\nExample \u2192 <a href=\"https:\/\/www.google.com\/search?q=love+coupons+intitle%3Aprintables+inurl%3Aprintables+-pinterest&amp;oq=love+coupons+intitle%3Aprintables+inurl%3Aprintables+-pinterest&amp;aqs=chrome..69i57j69i64l3.179j0j9&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8\">love coupons intitle:printables inurl:printables -pinterest<\/a>\r\n<h3>6. intitle:[input] link round up<\/h3>\r\nLink round ups are an option for content that doesn\u2019t have an inherent shareable, but that you\u2019d still like to promote to give it that nudge to start ranking. By using intitle:\u201dlink round up\u201d and similar search strings, you can find link round ups from sites within your content niche. Remember to filter by posts within the last month or week to only pull recent round ups.\r\n\r\nVariations:\r\n<ul>\r\n \t<li>[input] intitle:daily link round up<\/li>\r\n \t<li>[input] intitle:weekly link round up<\/li>\r\n \t<li>[input] intitle:monthly link round up<\/li>\r\n \t<li>[input] intitle:notable blog posts<\/li>\r\n \t<li>[input] intitle:best blog posts<\/li>\r\n \t<li>[input] intitle:favorite blog posts<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\nExample \u2192 <a href=\"https:\/\/www.google.com\/search?q=wellness+intitle%3Around+up&amp;oq=wellness+intitle%3Around+up&amp;aqs=chrome..69i57.177j0j9&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8\">wellness intitle:round up<\/a>\r\n<h3>7. [topic] inurl:write-for-us<\/h3>\r\nWe talk a lot about Google\u2019s <a href=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/conversation\/google-guest-posting\">guest posting guidelines<\/a>. These opportunities only make sense if the site you\u2019re pitching is a natural fit for your content with an audience that would be genuinely interested. The key point is to focus on pitching great content, and a guest post may be the vehicle through which it gets shared. It\u2019s best not to rely on this tactic as your primary link building strategy, as there\u2019s a lot of grey area here.\r\n\r\nExample \u2192 <a href=\"https:\/\/www.google.com\/search?q=workplace+productivity+inurl%3Awrite-for-us&amp;oq=workplace+productivity+inurl%3Awrite-for-us&amp;aqs=chrome..69i57.200j0j9&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8\">workplace productivity inurl:write-for-us<\/a>\r\n<h3>8. [topic] inurl:[audience] inurl:blog<\/h3>\r\nIf you need to find blogs targeted at a specific persona within a topical niche, this operator will help you get more granular. Depending on how niche your audience is, results may be sparse \u2014 but likely highly relevant.\r\n\r\nExample \u2192 <a href=\"https:\/\/www.google.com\/search?q=baby+food+inurl%3Anew-moms+inurl%3Ablog&amp;oq=baby+food+inurl%3Anew-moms+inurl%3Ablog&amp;aqs=chrome..69i57.200j0j9&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8\">baby food inurl:new-moms inurl:blog<\/a>\r\n<h3>9. \u201cMy experience with X\u201d inurl:blog<\/h3>\r\nSometimes you\u2019ll need to find bloggers who have been through a specific circumstance and know what it\u2019s like first-hand. A prospect with a personal experience with a topic \u2014 like pregnancy or getting engaged \u2014 means they may be more receptive towards your relevant content.\r\n\r\nExample \u2192 <a href=\"https:\/\/www.google.com\/search?q=%E2%80%9CMy+experience+with+burnout%E2%80%9D+inurl%3Ablog&amp;oq=%E2%80%9CMy+experience+with+burnout%E2%80%9D+inurl%3Ablog&amp;aqs=chrome..69i57.200j0j4&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8\">\u201cMy experience with burnout\u201d inurl:blog<\/a>\r\n<h3>10. [industry] coach inurl:blog<\/h3>\r\nDepending on your industry, there may be independent coaches or advisors who run their own blog and are receptive to outside content. This is particularly common in the realm of personal success, organization and productivity. Just <a href=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/marketing\/qualify-sites-for-link-outreach\">be on the lookout for signs<\/a> of site monetization, as they may charge for content placement.\r\n\r\nExample \u2192 <a href=\"https:\/\/www.google.com\/search?q=professional+organization+coach+inurl%3Ablog&amp;oq=professional+organization+coach+inurl%3Ablog&amp;aqs=chrome..69i57.188j0j9&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8\">professional organization coach inurl:blog<\/a>\r\n<a name=\"news\"><\/a>\r\n<h2>Pitching High-end News<\/h2>\r\nHigh authority news placements are notoriously hard to earn. Your content has to be timely, surprising, relevant, emotional, useful and more just to get the attention of a reporter. Search operators help cut down the time spent searching so you can spend more time crafting personalized pitches and <a href=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/marketing\/email-subject-line-best-practices\">subject lines that get noticed<\/a>.\r\n<h3>11. [topic] \u201csurvey reveals\u201d<\/h3>\r\nTo find journalists covering similar surveys in your field, search Google News for \u201csurvey reveals.\u201d Remember to set the time to the past month or week, as the news cycle moves fast and you want to make sure you\u2019re pulling recent and relevant journalism.\r\n\r\nVariations:\r\n<ul>\r\n \t<li>[topic] \u201cdata reveals\u201d<\/li>\r\n \t<li>[topic] \u201cstudy reveals\u201d<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\nExample \u2192 <a href=\"https:\/\/www.google.com\/search?q=credit+cards+%E2%80%9Csurvey+reveals%E2%80%9D&amp;oq=credit+cards+%E2%80%9Csurvey+reveals%E2%80%9D&amp;aqs=chrome..69i57.132j0j9&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8\">credit cards \u201csurvey reveals\u201d<\/a>\r\n<h3>12. [city] ranked best city for *<\/h3>\r\nWhen promoting city studies, you\u2019ll need to pinpoint local journalists and publications based on the cities that ranked at the top (or in some cases, at the bottom). Use [city] ranked best for * to find other articles sharing city studies related to that location. The wildcard asterisk opens up the possibilities of all types of city studies, so you\u2019ll need to vet the reporter to ensure your pitch is relevant to their beat.\r\n\r\nExample \u2192 <a href=\"https:\/\/www.google.com\/search?q=Austin+ranked+best+city+for+*&amp;oq=Austin+ranked+best+city+for+*&amp;aqs=chrome..69i57j69i64.178j0j9&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8\">Austin ranked best city for *<\/a>\r\n<h3>13. inurl:cityof<\/h3>\r\nAnother way to find city-specific publications is to include \u201ccityof\u201d in an inurl search. This works best when you\u2019re looking for more authoritative sites to share important and authoritative content around topics such as health, safety and the environment.\r\n\r\nExample \u2192 <a href=\"https:\/\/www.google.com\/search?q=fire+safety+inurl%3Acityof&amp;oq=fire+safety+inurl%3Acityof&amp;aqs=chrome..69i57.200j0j9&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8\">fire safety inurl:cityof<\/a>\r\n<h3>14. [author] [company] (site:facebook.com | site:twitter.com | site:linkedin.com)<\/h3>\r\nIf a freelance writer or reporter\u2019s contact information isn\u2019t easily accessible, turn to Google with this combination of site searches. The goal is to pull up any relevant social media profiles that may have clues on how to best get in contact with the prospect.\r\n\r\nExample \u2192 <a href=\"https:\/\/www.google.com\/search?q=Larry+Page+Google+(site%3Afacebook.com+%7C+site%3Atwitter.com+%7C+site%3Alinkedin.com)&amp;oq=Larry+Page+Google+(site%3Afacebook.com+%7C+site%3Atwitter.com+%7C+site%3Alinkedin.com)&amp;aqs=chrome..69i57.200j0j9&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8\">Larry Page Google (site:facebook.com | site:twitter.com | site:linkedin.com)<\/a>\r\n<h3>15. intitle:[topic] news round up<\/h3>\r\nIf you\u2019re having trouble earning placements for your survey or data study, news round ups may be a low-hanging fruit opportunity.\r\n\r\nExample \u2192 <a href=\"https:\/\/www.google.com\/search?q=intitle%3Acoronavirus+news+round+up&amp;oq=intitle%3Acoronavirus+news+round+up&amp;aqs=chrome..69i57j69i58.200j0j9&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8\">intitle:coronavirus news round up<\/a>\r\n<h3>16. [keyword] intext:\u201dpowered by wordpress\u201d<\/h3>\r\nIn addition to inurl:blog, intext:\u201dpowered by wordpress\u201d allows you to find industry-relevant blogs that may not have \u201cblog\u201d present in their URL structure.\r\n\r\nExample \u2192 <a href=\"https:\/\/www.google.com\/search?q=eco-friendly+hacks+intext%3A%E2%80%9Dpowered+by+wordpress%E2%80%9D&amp;oq=eco-friendly+hacks+intext%3A%E2%80%9Dpowered+by+wordpress%E2%80%9D&amp;aqs=chrome..69i57.143j0j9&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8\">eco-friendly hacks intext:\u201dpowered by wordpress\u201d<\/a>\r\n<a name=\"blb\"><\/a>\r\n<h2>Conducting Broken Link Building<\/h2>\r\nThere\u2019s pretty much no better time to use Google search operators than in your broken link building campaigns. Also referred to as <a href=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/marketing\/homepage-links-resource-outreach\">resource page outreach<\/a>, this strategy involves locating \u201clinks\u201d and \u201cresources\u201d pages at scale. These operators are a key step in the process.\r\n<h3>17. [input] -.gov<\/h3>\r\nUse -.gov to exclude government sites from the SERP. This is helpful when vetting a brainstorm idea for social proof and link potential, as government-affiliated resources will naturally yield larger backlink profiles due to their authoritative nature.\r\n\r\nExample \u2192 <a href=\"https:\/\/www.google.com\/search?q=travel+safety+guide+-.gov&amp;oq=travel+safety+guide+-.gov&amp;aqs=chrome..69i57j69i64.166j0j9&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8\">travel safety guide -.gov<\/a>\r\n<h3>18. [input] -.org<\/h3>\r\nLike -.gov, -.org excludes nonprofit organizations. This operator is key when searching for commercial content related to a niche that is heavily dominated by nonprofits \u2014 such as health or childcare.\r\n\r\nExample \u2192 <a href=\"https:\/\/www.google.com\/search?q=lung+cancer+statistics+2020+-.org&amp;oq=lung+cancer+statistics+2020+-.org&amp;aqs=chrome..69i57.166j0j9&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8\">lung cancer statistics 2020 -.org<\/a>\r\n<h3>19. [input] -.edu<\/h3>\r\nIf you have a client in the education space, you\u2019ll likely be searching for content around scholarships, classroom activities, lesson plans and other topics. Using -.edu filters out high-DA universities.\r\n\r\nExample \u2192 <a href=\"https:\/\/www.google.com\/search?q=scholarships+for+minorities+-.edu&amp;oq=scholarships+for+minorities+-.edu&amp;aqs=chrome..69i57.189j0j9&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8\">scholarships for minorities -.edu<\/a>\r\n<h3>20. [input] inurl:links<\/h3>\r\nWhen doing broken link building, the goal is to find broken links on a page and reach out to the site and suggest they fix the link and add yours. But first, you\u2019ll need to find these links pages.\r\n\r\nThat\u2019s where inurl:links comes in handy. Searches for resource pages often yield highly authoritative government pages, so it\u2019s best to couple this with -.gov, -.org or -.edu to ensure you\u2019re weeding these out.\r\n\r\nVariations:\r\n<ul>\r\n \t<li>[input] inurl:useful-links<\/li>\r\n \t<li>[input] intitle:\u201duseful links\u201d<\/li>\r\n \t<li>[input] inurl:helpful-links<\/li>\r\n \t<li>[input] intitle:\u201dhelpful links\u201d<\/li>\r\n \t<li>[input] inurl:favorite-links<\/li>\r\n \t<li>[input] intitle:\u201dfavorite links\u201d<\/li>\r\n \t<li>[input] inurl: recommended-links<\/li>\r\n \t<li>[input] intitle:\u201drecommended links\u201d<\/li>\r\n \t<li>[input] inurl: interesting-links<\/li>\r\n \t<li>[input] intitle:\u201dinteresting links\u201d<\/li>\r\n \t<li>[input] inurl: suggested-links<\/li>\r\n \t<li>[input] intitle:\u201dsuggested links\u201d<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\nExample \u2192 <a href=\"https:\/\/www.google.com\/search?q=child+safety+inurl%3Alinks+intitle%3Alinks+-.org+-.gov&amp;oq=child+safety+inurl%3Alinks+intitle%3Alinks+-.org+-.gov&amp;aqs=chrome..69i57.155j0j9&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8\">child safety inurl:links intitle:links -.org -.gov<\/a>\r\n<h3>21. [input] inurl:resources<\/h3>\r\nAnother approach to broken link building is to find resource pages. Just like links pages, you\u2019ll have more success filtering out more authoritative top level domains.\r\n\r\nVariations:\r\n<ul>\r\n \t<li>[input] inurl:useful-resources<\/li>\r\n \t<li>[input] intitle:\u201duseful resources\u201d<\/li>\r\n \t<li>[input] inurl:helpful-resources<\/li>\r\n \t<li>[input] intitle:\u201dhelpful resources\u201d<\/li>\r\n \t<li>[input] inurl:external-resources<\/li>\r\n \t<li>[input] intitle:\u201dexternal resources\u201d<\/li>\r\n \t<li>[input] inurl:outside-resources<\/li>\r\n \t<li>[input] intitle:\u201dexternal resources\u201d<\/li>\r\n \t<li>[input] inurl: recommended-resources<\/li>\r\n \t<li>[input] intitle:\u201drecommended resources\u201d<\/li>\r\n \t<li>[input] inurl: suggested-resources<\/li>\r\n \t<li>[input] intitle:\u201dsuggested resources\u201d<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\nExample \u2192 <a href=\"https:\/\/www.google.com\/search?q=senior+safety+inurl%3Aresources+intitle%3Aresources+-.gov+-.org&amp;oq=senior+safety+inurl%3Aresources+intitle%3Aresources+-.gov+-.org&amp;aqs=chrome..69i57.155j0j9&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8\">senior safety inurl:resources intitle:resources -.gov -.org<\/a>\r\n<h3>22. [input] \u201csuggest resource\u201d | \u201csubmit resource\u201d | \u201crecommend resource\u201d<\/h3>\r\nUse this combination to find resource pages open to sharing URLs for your broken link building campaigns.\r\n\r\nVariations:\r\n<ul>\r\n \t<li>[input] \u201csuggest link\u201d | \u201csubmit link\u201d | \u201crecommend link\u201d<\/li>\r\n \t<li>[input] \u201csuggest URL\u201d | \u201csubmit URL\u201d | \u201crecommend URL\u201d<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\nExample \u2192 <a href=\"https:\/\/www.google.com\/search?q=veterans+%E2%80%9Csuggest+resource%E2%80%9D+%7C+%E2%80%9Csubmit+resource%E2%80%9D+%7C+%E2%80%9Crecommend+resource%E2%80%9D&amp;oq=veterans+%E2%80%9Csuggest+resource%E2%80%9D+%7C+%E2%80%9Csubmit+resource%E2%80%9D+%7C+%E2%80%9Crecommend+resource%E2%80%9D&amp;aqs=chrome..69i57.177j0j9&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8\">veterans \u201csuggest resource\u201d | \u201csubmit resource\u201d | \u201crecommend resource\u201d<\/a>\r\n<h3>23. [keyword] inurl:k12 inurl:resources<\/h3>\r\nUse inurl:k12 to find resource pages within school sites. This is ideal when promoting a parenting guide or anything related to child safety, cybersecurity, learning and scholarships.\r\n\r\nExample \u2192 <a href=\"https:\/\/www.google.com\/search?q=Bullying+resources+inurl%3Ak12+inurl%3Aresources&amp;oq=Bullying+resources+inurl%3Ak12+inurl%3Aresources&amp;aqs=chrome..69i57.155j0j9&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8\">Bullying resources inurl:k12 inurl:resources<\/a>\r\n<a name=\"reclamation\"><\/a>\r\n<h2>Link Reclamation Opportunities<\/h2>\r\n<a href=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/marketing\/advanced-link-reclamation\">Link reclamation<\/a> is the process of searching for existing brand mentions and reaching out to the publication to ask if they will link back to your site. It\u2019s a process that drives SEO value for your site \u2014 but it also adds value to the reader, allowing them to easily click over to your site to access more information if they\u2019re curious. The process can be time-intensive, and search operators streamline the process.\r\n<h3>24. [title of survey or main findings] -yourURL<\/h3>\r\nThis is a link reclamation tactic used to find unlinked mentions of a study or survey your client ran. You can either choose to search the exact headline of your study or enter in a key finding or data point.\r\n\r\nExample \u2192 <a href=\"https:\/\/www.google.com\/search?q=43%25+average+amount+of+air+in+a+bag+of+chips+-kitchencabinetkings.com&amp;oq=43%25+average+amount+of+air+in+a+bag+of+chips+-kitchencabinetkings.com&amp;aqs=chrome..69i57.199j0j9&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8\">43% average amount of air in a bag of chips -kitchencabinetkings.com<\/a>\r\n<h3>25. \u201c[definition]\u201d -yourURL<\/h3>\r\nAnother link reclamation strategy is to search for sites who used your original definition verbatim without linking to you as the information source.\r\n\r\nExample \u2192 <a href=\"https:\/\/www.google.com\/search?q=%E2%80%9CLink+building+is+the+process+of+acquiring+hyperlinks+from+other+websites+around+the+web.%E2%80%9D+-siegemedia.com&amp;oq=%E2%80%9CLink+building+is+the+process+of+acquiring+hyperlinks+from+other+websites+around+the+web.%E2%80%9D+-siegemedia.com&amp;aqs=chrome..69i57.155j0j9&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8\">\u201cLink building is the process of acquiring hyperlinks from other websites around the web.\u201d -siegemedia.com<\/a>\r\n<h2>Beyond Outreach: 3 Additional Uses for Search Operators<\/h2>\r\nWhile search operators are essential for efficient outreach, their utility doesn\u2019t stop there. From content creators to technical SEOs, search operators have a place in everyone\u2019s workflow.\r\n\r\n<img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-21930\" src=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/10\/3-additional-uses-1.png\" alt=\"search operator uses\" width=\"1401\" height=\"554\" \/>\r\n<h3>Find Internal Links<\/h3>\r\nIf you\u2019re searching for content to internally link to in your article, simply conduct a site: search containing relevant keywords. So if I was writing a piece on working from home for Business Insider, I could search <a href=\"https:\/\/www.google.com\/search?q=site%3Abusinessinsider.com+%E2%80%9Cstanding+desk%E2%80%9D&amp;oq=site%3Abusinessinsider.com+%E2%80%9Cstanding+desk%E2%80%9D&amp;aqs=chrome..69i57j69i58.144j0j9&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8\">site:businessinsider.com \u201cstanding desk\u201d<\/a> to find a tangentially-related piece I could link to in my post.\r\n<h3>Locate Duplicate Content<\/h3>\r\nIf you suspect duplicate content on your site, Google search operators can help you locate it. Simply combine site:[your URL] and intext:[suspected duplicate content] to locate pages with repeated copy.\r\n<h3>Determine Indexed Pages<\/h3>\r\nConducting a site: search will let you see which pages on your site have been indexed by Google. To take this a step further, you can search for pages within folders as well as subdomains. So if you want to see which mint.com pages are indexed, you could search for<a href=\"https:\/\/www.google.com\/search?q=site%3Amint.com%2Fhow-it-works&amp;oq=site%3Amint.com%2Fhow-it-works&amp;aqs=chrome..69i57j69i59j69i58.154j0j9&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8\"> site:mint.com\/how-it-works<\/a> or <a href=\"https:\/\/www.google.com\/search?q=site%3Ablog.mint.com&amp;oq=site%3Ablog.mint.com&amp;aqs=chrome..69i57j69i58.1169j0j4&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8\">site:blog.mint.com<\/a>.\r\n<h2>Less Time Searching = More Time Strategizing<\/h2>\r\nWhen used strategically, Google search operators cut down on the amount of time you spend searching \u2014 allowing you to spend more time on prospecting, pitching and personalizing. We love getting granular with search to inform content strategy and ensure high-quality, relevant links that deliver real results."

Use Social Media<\/h2>\r\nA more roundabout way to increase incoming links is to get active on social media and engage regularly with reporters and bloggers in your niche. \r\n\r\nCreating and building an online presence for your brand will increase your audience size, boost page views, and can even lead to new links over time.\r\n\r\nHere are some tips when using social media for link building: \r\n<ul>\r\n<li><strong>Use hashtags strategically:<\/strong> Say a reporter searches for a hashtag on Twitter, and you used that same hashtag to tweet about a recent study you wrote. You might get coverage from that tweet.<\/li> \r\n<li><strong>Find journalist requesting data:<\/strong> Journalists even use Twitter to request data, so monitor hashtags like #journorequest or #prrequest for linking opportunities that fit your brand.<\/li>\r\n<li><strong>Actively engage on industry platforms:<\/strong> Commenting on others' blog posts is another strategy you can implement to boost your brand awareness.<\/li> \r\n<\/ul>\r\n\r\nThese strategies not only show that you are an active participant in industry conversations, but also help you build a relationship with other bloggers who may reach out to you for coverage in the future.\r\n\r\n<h2 id=\"broken-link-building\">2. Perform Broken Link Building<\/h2>\r\nBroken link building \u2014 also known as BLB \u2014 is a strategy that helps secure links on resource pages by finding broken links currently listed and suggesting your post as an alternative. \r\n\r\nIt's a relatively easy way to earn links because after you\u2019ve created your piece of content, most of the work is off your plate. \r\n\r\n[video width=\"1400\" height=\"874\" mp4=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/11\/check-broken-links.mp4\"][\/video]\r\n<br>\r\n\r\nYou\u2019ll want to create a guide that covers a topic relevant to your site in order to get links that prove your value and will be an alternative for that broken link. For example, as a content marketing agency, creating a list of <a href=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/creation\/data-sources\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">free data sources<\/a> will bring value to other content creators looking to level up their pieces with relevant statistics. \r\n\r\n<strong>When beginning your BLB research, there are search modifiers you can add to your keywords to filter out irrelevant pages. Examples include:<\/strong>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n     <li><strong>Inurl:resources<\/strong><\/li>\r\n     <li><strong>Inurl:links<\/strong><\/li>\r\n     <li><strong>Inurl:useful-links<\/strong><\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n\r\nWhen used in tandem with topical keywords, you can start your search for potential prospects on the right foot. But what exactly do you say once you find a good prospect? We\u2019re glad you asked.\r\n\r\n<blockquote class=\"definition\"><h4>BLB Outreach Template<\/h4>\r\nHere is an example outreach email from a BLB campaign that had an average 68% open rate and a 36% click-through rate.\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/11\/blb-outreach-template.png\" alt=\"An image shows an outreach template for broken link building\" width=\"2825\" height=\"2847\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-30647\" \/>\r\n\r\nThis email works because it gets straight to the point. \r\n\r\nNot only does this keep prospects from bouncing off your email, it also makes customization easier on you. Make sure to link to the prospect's resource page in the body of the email so it\u2019s easier for both of you to return to it as needed.\r\n<\/blockquote>\r\n\r\n<h2 id=\"competitor-links\">3. Look at Competitors\u2019 Links<\/h2>\r\nOne good way to find out which link building strategy works for your type of content is by doing some \"spying\" on your competitors by looking at your competitor's links, also known as backlinks. \r\n\r\nAnd as a bonus, this helps you understand the type of content your audience enjoys and links to the most. \r\n\r\nThere are a couple of ways you can do this. By using a tool such as <a href=\"https:\/\/ahrefs.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Ahrefs<\/a>, you can: \r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><strong>Look at your competitors\u2019 top pages<\/strong> to learn what type of content brings them the most traffic and which keywords they\u2019re targeting.<\/li>\r\n<li><strong>Look at your competitors\u2019 links<\/strong> to learn which pages get the most links and who's linking to them the most.<\/li> \r\n<li><strong>Look at your competitors\u2019 posts<\/strong> to learn what type of content and which keywords are ranking the highest to get some inspiration.<\/li> \r\n<\/ul>\r\n\r\n[video width=\"1396\" height=\"904\" mp4=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/11\/check-backlinks.mp4\"][\/video]\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n<strong>When analyzing your competitors\u2019 posts, ask yourself these questions:<\/strong> \r\n<ul>\r\n<li><strong>Are they doing guest blogging?<\/strong><\/li>\r\n<li><strong>What post format seems to be the most effective?<\/strong><\/li>\r\n<li><strong>Which pages and markets are linking to them?<\/strong><\/li> \r\n<li><strong>Which keywords are they targeting?<\/strong><\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n\r\nThis way, you'll not only have a better understanding of the type of content to create that will generate links, but also which markets and websites to reach out to. You can then perform outreach, targeting markets and sites that link to your competitors the most. \r\n\r\n<blockquote class=\"definition\">Keep in mind that if you're seeing a lot of placements on high-value websites, like CNN or Forbes, your competitors are likely doing paid placements.<\/blockquote>\r\n\r\n<h2 id=\"website-visibility\">4. Make Your Website More Visible<\/h2>\r\nIf you want to build more links to your website, you need to also build a personal brand and increase your visibility. \r\n\r\nOne way to do that is by investing your time in <a href=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/strategy\/off-page-seo\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">off-page SEO<\/a>, which consists of optimization strategies not directly made to your website, such as local citations and fixing broken links. \r\n\r\n<strong>Some of these strategies include:<\/strong> \r\n<ul>\r\n     <li><strong>Ensuring third-party citations are accurate and consistent:<\/strong> Double-check information like your name, address, and phone number are correct.<\/li>  \r\n     <li><strong>Creating and maintaining your Google My Business listing:<\/strong> If your business has a physical address, create a listing on Google and update the information regularly.<\/li>  \r\n     <li><strong>Claiming your listing on popular user-generated content sites:<\/strong> Contact the site to claim your business and provide them with the right information.<\/li> \r\n     <li><\/strong>Improving the public perception of your brand:<\/strong> Invest in digital PR, social media marketing, influencer marketing, and review management.<\/li> \r\n<\/ul>\r\n\r\n<h2 id=\"link-tracking\">5. Keep Track of Your Links<\/h2>\r\nIf you're like us, you're probably guilty of checking for new links at least once a week \u2014 or maybe every day, but we won't judge. \r\n\r\nAside from ensuring you have a healthy backlink profile, keeping track of your links helps you understand who is contributing to your backlink profile, meaning who links to your site. This way, you'll be able to focus on relevant industries when performing outreach and creating content. \r\n\r\nThere's also a thing called <a href=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/marketing\/link-relevancy\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">link relevancy<\/a>, which is even more important than the authority of those who link to you. \r\n\r\nThat's because when you have relevant links, you're telling Google that you're a trusted source for your industry. This helps you rank for terms that are important to your business. \r\n\r\n<h2 id=\"share-content-forums\">6. Share Your Content on Forums<\/h2>\r\nForums are a great way to find answers to your questions and connect with people online. They can also be a useful link building strategy since they provide a valuable way to get more traffic to your blog post, which increases the chances of people linking to you. \r\n\r\nWhen sharing your content on forums, it's important not to just link to your post and hope for the best. After all, forums usually have rules and common practices to follow, and you need to abide by them. \r\n\r\n<strong>When sharing your post on forums, you should:<\/strong>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><strong>Add to the conversation by answering comments.<\/strong><\/li> \r\n<li><strong>Give tips and advice.<\/strong><\/li> \r\n<li><strong>Follow the forum rules.<\/strong><\/li> \r\n<li><strong>Link to your post as an extra resource.<\/strong><\/li> \r\n<\/ul>\r\n\r\nTo find forums to post on, start by searching for topics or common questions people ask related to your industry. Alternatively, you can make a habit of browsing through forums related to your topic. \r\n\r\nYou can engage on forums such as:\r\n<ul>\r\n    <li>Reddit<\/li>\r\n    <li>Quora<\/li>\r\n    <li>Facebook Pages<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\nAs a bonus, browsing through forums might spike your creativity and introduce you to new topics and keywords to write about. \r\n\r\n<img src=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/11\/intermmediate-link-building-strategies-v2.png\" alt=\"A graphic shows the intermediate link building strategies\" width=\"1400\" height=\"1279\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-30630\" \/>\r\n\r\n<h2 id=\"link-reclamation\">7. Try Link Reclamation<\/h2>\r\nLink reclamation is the process of reclaiming lost or unlinked organic mentions to your site. \r\n\r\nWhile this strategy is most successful for bigger brands that get a lot of press coverage, you can still see positive results as a smaller website. \r\n\r\n<strong>There are two tactics for link reclamation:<\/strong>  \r\n<ul>\r\n    <li><strong>Reclaiming a lost link:<\/strong> If a website used to link to your site but removed the link later, there\u2019s a possibility you can reach out to resecure that coverage.<\/li>\r\n    <li><strong>Correcting un-linked organic mentions:<\/strong> If a website mentions your brand name but doesn't link to it, email them and ask for proper credit to a relevant page.<\/li>\r\n<\/ul> \r\n\r\n<blockquote class=\"definition\"><h4>Link Reclamation Outreach Template<\/h4>\r\nBelow is an example email that can lead to a 68% open rate when customized properly.\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/11\/link-reclamation-outreach-template.png\" alt=\"An image shows an outreach template for link reclamation\" width=\"2825\" height=\"2789\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-30648\" \/>\r\n\r\nTo take your link reclamation strategy to the next level and execute lesser-known link moves, check out our <a href=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/marketing\/advanced-link-reclamation\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">advanced link reclamation<\/a> blog post.<\/blockquote>\r\n\r\n<h2 id=\"guest-blogging\">8. Consider Guest Blogging<\/h2>\r\n\r\nLikely the strategy you\u2019ve heard about the most and probably even tried yourself, guest blogging is another great way to earn mid- to top-tier links back to your site. \r\n\r\nYou might've heard that Google warns against guest posting, but that doesn\u2019t mean you need to stay away from it entirely. The new version of guest posting is all about intention.\r\n\r\nApproach your guest posting strategy with an intent to educate, and look for sites that share outside content without advertising guest posting opportunities. \r\n\r\nWithin that realm, you\u2019ll find mid- to top-tier sites with topical relevance that will likely accept great content.\r\n\r\nReaching out to a site that doesn\u2019t explicitly ask for pitches can be tricky. With these outreach emails, it\u2019s important to highlight why their readers should care about your content. \r\n\r\n<blockquote class=\"definition\"><h4>Guest Blogging Outreach Template<\/h4>\r\nBelow is a sample template you can use to get started.\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/11\/guest-blogging-outreach-template.png\" alt=\"An image shows an outreach template for guest blogging\" width=\"2824\" height=\"2573\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-30649\" \/>\r\n\r\nOnce you start getting some bites, the next task is writing up the guest post. \r\n\r\nMake sure to highlight the most important findings from your original post, but don\u2019t duplicate copy word for word \u2014 Google frowns upon that. Instead, make your copy unique and authoritative by focusing on the new audience you\u2019re speaking to.<\/blockquote>\r\n\r\n<h2 id=\"passive-links\">9. Focus on Passive Links<\/h2>\r\nAt Siege, we've learned that on average, the cost per link of search-driven posts on an 18-month timeline was <a href=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/marketing\/cost-per-link-analysis\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">significantly better<\/a> than link-driven posts. The main strategy behind this process is to find topics that have strong passive link intent, and then watch all the organic links wash in.\r\n\r\nAs a rough indicator, look for topics you or your competitors rank for on Ahrefs\u2019 Top Pages view that have a high number of links. If it has traffic and a good number of links, that\u2019s a strong first indicator that it has passive link intent.\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/cpl-analysis-9.png\" alt=\"Ahrefs top pages\" width=\"1400\" height=\"685\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-21634\" \/>\r\n\r\nFrom there, you\u2019ll want to confirm that the links are steadily building, as opposed to building through a big spike or manual campaign. \r\n\r\nIf you see a gradual graph, that\u2019s a good sign that if you can get ranking, you\u2019ll generate passive links to your domain.\r\n\r\nFor more on this process, we recommend watching the following video where we break down additional passive link generation strategies:\r\n\r\n<div class=\"video-container\"><iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/mxEzl81jS-4\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen><\/iframe><\/div>\r\n\r\n<h2 id=\"include-infographics\">10. Include Infographics<\/h2>\r\n\r\nCreating <a href=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/services\/infographic-design\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">beautifully designed infographics<\/a> can be a good way to secure valuable links on a weekly basis. And when coupled with informative and interesting articles, infographics make great fodder for guest posts. \r\n\r\nUsing infographics as an addition to your informative post \u2014 rather than the main part of the post itself \u2014 means you\u2019re likely to get more topical links from bloggers rather than the typical (highly penalized) infographic farm sites.\r\n\r\nA well-designed and maybe even animated asset, like <a href=\"https:\/\/clevertap.com\/blog\/microinteractions\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">this example from CleverTap<\/a>, helps take your <a href=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/marketing\/how-to-pitch-infographics\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">infographic pitch<\/a> to the next level and encourages a quicker share. You can highlight your design asset in your pitch, too. \r\n\r\n<blockquote class=\"definition\"><h4>Outreach Template With Infographic Template<\/h4>\r\nHighlight the infographic from your post when performing outreach. This way, you can offer websites a chance to share your infographic that will link back to your post. \r\n\r\n<img src=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/11\/infographic-outreach-template.png\" alt=\"An image shows an outreach template that includes an infographic\" width=\"2825\" height=\"4424\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-30650\" \/>\r\n\r\nIn the outreach email, mention what your post covers and include only a sneak peek of the infographic to prompt the prospect to click on it.<\/blockquote>\r\n\r\n<h2 id=\"target-resource-pages\">11. Target Resource Pages<\/h2>\r\n<a href=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/marketing\/creative-content\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Creating informative and unique content<\/a> means you can also target pages looking to share your post as a resource. \r\n\r\nThis works especially well for content revolving around beginner \"how-to\" and \"what is\" topics. \r\n\r\nThese types of posts tend to be longer, overviewing everything you need to know about a topic. For example, Zola\u2019s post on <a href=\"https:\/\/www.zola.com\/expert-advice\/how-to-plan-a-wedding\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">how to plan a wedding<\/a> is a great addition to a resource page for wedding planners. \r\n\r\nAfter creating your resource post, you can start to look for websites that have a resource page that could link it. \r\n\r\n<strong>To do this, search for pages using search modifiers together with your keyword. For example:<\/strong> \r\n<ul>\r\n     <li><strong>Inurl:resources<\/strong><\/li>\r\n     <li><strong>Intitle:resource page<\/strong><\/li>\r\n     <li><strong>Intitle:helpful links<\/strong><\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n\r\n<blockquote class=\"definition\"><h4>Resource Page Outreach Template<\/h4>\r\nWhen reaching out to prospects, mention that you found their resource page helpful and that you have another resource you think could add value to their page.\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/11\/resource-page-outreach-template.png\" alt=\"An image shows an outreach email template for targeting a resource page\" width=\"2825\" height=\"2575\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-30651\" \/>\r\n\r\nIn the outreach email, mention what your post covers and include only a sneak peek of the infographic to prompt the prospect to click on it.<\/blockquote>\r\n\r\n<h2 id=\"roundup-posts\">12. Create Roundup Posts<\/h2>\r\nFrom the best savings tips to ways to style your hair, roundup posts can provide great inspiration to readers. What's even better is that they\u2019re also great in terms of shareability, just like many of the link building strategies on our list. \r\n\r\nWhen creating a roundup post, you want to break away from linking to only your own posts, and try linking to other trustworthy websites. \r\n\r\nThis way, if your content is high quality, the websites you linked to might share your article with their audience. \r\n\r\n<strong>To find some ideas for roundup posts, add search modifiers to your keyword or niche, such as:<\/strong> \r\n<ul>\r\n<li><strong>Intitle:roundup<\/strong><\/li>\r\n<li><strong>Intitle:best<\/strong><\/li>\r\n<li><strong>Intitle:top<\/strong><\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n\r\nYou can then increase your chances of getting links by reaching out to the websites you linked to. \r\n\r\n<blockquote class=\"definition\"><h4>Roundup Post Outreach Template<\/h4>\r\nWhen emailing prospects, mention that they were featured in your recent article and ask if they\u2019d like to share it with their audience.\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/11\/roundup-outreach-template.png\" alt=\"An image shows an outreach email template for roundup posts\" width=\"2824\" height=\"2413\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-30652\" \/><\/blockquote>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/11\/advanced-link-building-strategies-v2.png\" alt=\"A graphic shows the advanced link building strategies\" width=\"2825\" height=\"2279\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-30628\" \/>\r\n\r\n<h2 id=\"newsjacking\">13. Consider Newsjacking<\/h2>\r\nNewsjacking is a link building <a href=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/marketing\/what-is-digital-pr\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">digital PR tactic<\/a> that involves spotting opportunities in the news and creating relevant content with your added opinions and thoughts \u2014 and usually promoting your or your client's work while doing so. \r\n\r\nThis strategy works because more people will be searching for the topic and it helps build <a href=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/seo\/what-is-eat\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">expertise and trust<\/a>, especially if you have credible people giving insights and offering tips. \r\n\r\nBut this also means you will have to keep tabs on industry news, podcasts, and roundups and create content quickly \u2014 news stories generally only last 24-72 hours! \r\n\r\nNewsjacking works for many different industries, from finance to lifestyle. It's just a matter of keeping up with current events and being able to relate it to your content. \r\n\r\nFor example, if your client sells mattresses and there's some newsworthy buzz around quality sleep and mental health, you can create a post on how their mattress affects quality of sleep. \r\n\r\nTo increase your chance of earning links to your newsjacking piece, you can also perform outreach and target news websites that would cover your story. \r\n\r\n<h2 id=\"create-surveys\">14. Create Surveys<\/h2>\r\nEver see a survey from a small company that goes viral and think: How did they do it? Surveys can be hard to get right, since they require time and sometimes lead to irrelevant results. But when they work, it can pay off in droves.\r\n\r\n<strong>Survey content works for several reasons:<\/strong>\r\n<ul>\r\n     <li>You get to pitch completely organic and unique data.<\/li> \r\n     <li>You can make sure your questions directly tie to your brand's offerings.<\/li> \r\n     <li>You can break out your data by demographics for more targeted results.<\/li> \r\n<\/ul>\r\nJournalists want to cover stories that will engage their audience. That means the key takeaway from your survey needs to be attention-grabbing. \r\n\r\nAnd while you should always have an end goal in mind when creating a survey, it\u2019s important to remember that the results may not always be what you hoped for. \r\n\r\nEven so, don\u2019t be afraid to work with the data to find another story that captivates or use external data to back up your point.\r\n\r\n<blockquote class=\"definition\"><h4>How They Did It<\/h4>\r\nThis survey from Tommy John on <a href=\"https:\/\/tommyjohn.com\/blogs\/news\/underwear-hygiene-study\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">American hygiene habits hits all the marks<\/a>.\r\n\r\nFirst, it draws readers in with an attention-grabbing headline. It also uses external data to back up their points and keep readers interested in learning more. And with 370+ links and counting, it\u2019s safe to say this method works.\r\n\r\nInterested in learning how to craft and pitch the perfect survey?

Collaborate With Opinion Leaders<\/h2>\r\nCollaborating with people with a media footprint, whether it\u2019s someone well known in your industry or even an influencer, can also be a good way to get your content seen. \r\n\r\nThis can increase your chances of getting links. Additionally, leveraging expert knowledge and experience puts more credibility behind your content. \r\n\r\nYou can, for example, add linkable expert quotes and statistics throughout your post to complement the content and make it easier for people to share it. Another option is to add images with expert quotes, similar to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.varonis.com\/blog\/working-in-cybersecurity\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">this post from Varonis<\/a>.  \r\n\r\n<img src=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/11\/varonis-expert-quote.jpg\" alt=\"An example of how to use an expert quote on your blog post to make it easier for people to share it\" width=\"1826\" height=\"1166\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-30569\" \/>\r\n\r\nThis is a link building strategy that will work better if you have networking experience or connections with thought leaders in your industry. \r\n\r\nBut you can still level up your content by sourcing expert quotes on HARO or Qwoted. You can then reach out to let them know their advice was featured in your article. \r\n\r\n<h2 id=\"data-studies\">16. Release Data Studies<\/h2>\r\nData studies use external or internal data points to tell a compelling story. Generally, data studies work best for bigger brands whose offerings are closely related to the topic of the study.\r\n\r\nPut yourself in the shoes of a reporter. If the brand pitching you is an insurance company, for example, does it make sense for them to be talking about the eating habits of consumers? Not really. \r\n\r\nJournalists and bloggers want to share data from certified experts, so it\u2019s important that your study reflects what your brand is all about.\r\n\r\n<blockquote class=\"definition\"><h4>Data Study Outreach Template<\/h4>\r\nWhen reaching out to reporters for data studies, keeping it short and to the point is your best route to coverage. \r\n\r\nHighlight key findings in bullet points, and let the journalists know why they should care. Then, link to your piece to let them read more if they want, just like in the example below.\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/11\/data-study-outreach-template.png\" alt=\"An image shows an outreach template for a data study\" width=\"2825\" height=\"4314\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-30644\" \/>\r\n\r\nIn the outreach email, mention what your post covers and include only a sneak peek of the infographic to prompt the prospect to click on it.<\/blockquote>\r\n\r\n<h2 id=\"conduct-city-studies\">17. Conduct City Studies<\/h2>\r\nA city study is a link building strategy that uses data from specific regions to make a statement about the people, businesses, or even weather patterns. \r\n\r\nCity studies often have great open and click-through rates as they are highly relevant to the journalists and bloggers in the region.\r\n\r\nWith city studies, you\u2019re able to target specific regions with topical information. This can help garner unique links to news outlets, resource pages, and blogs for different cities. \r\n\r\nYou can also use city studies to get links back to your location-specific product pages (if you have them) as they\u2019ll be useful for readers in that area. Talk about a win-win!\r\n\r\n<blockquote class=\"definition\"><h4>City Study Outreach Template<\/h4>\r\nWhen doing outreach for city studies, customization is extremely important. Consider targeting the top five cities on your list, and customize each email to the journalists\u2019 previous articles. \r\n\r\nThis way, they know that not only are you sending hyper-relevant content, but you took the time to read their previous work to make sure your pitch was a good fit for their beat. A template city study outreach email looks something like this.\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/11\/city-study-outreach-template.png\" alt=\"An image shows an outreach template for a city study\" width=\"2825\" height=\"3737\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-30645\" \/>\r\n<\/blockquote>\r\n \r\n<h2>Link Building Best Practices<\/h2>\r\nThere are a lot of options when it comes to link building strategies, but there isn\u2019t a one-size-fits-all solution.\r\n\r\n<strong>To ensure you're getting the most out of your efforts, remember to follow these link building best practices:<\/strong> \r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n     <li>Create useful and quality content that will make people want to share it.<\/li> \r\n     <li>Get to know your audience in order to attract the right people.<\/li>  \r\n     <li>Reach out to websites that are relevant to your content.<\/li>  \r\n     <li>Understand what your competition is doing well.<\/li>  \r\n     <li>Use social media and forums to bring more eyes to your page.<\/li>  \r\n     <li>Find websites that will link to you by using a <a href=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/marketing\/link-building-prospecting-scorecard\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">link building scorecard<\/a>.<\/li> \r\n\r\n<\/ul>\r\nIn order to be successful in this area of content marketing and SEO, your brand\u2019s authority, goals, and time constraints must all be taken into account before getting started. \r\n\r\nBut with an ever-changing industry, it can be hard to adapt. We believe that partnering up with a team of industry experts is the best way to <a href=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/services\/content-marketing\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">create content<\/a> that leads to scalable link acquisition."

They use the AIDA (Attention, Interest, Desire, Action) formula to intrigue prospects and entice them to open the email.\r\n\r\nWhen analyzing 100 email campaigns in a variety of industries, we found that email subject lines roughly 64 characters\u2014with an average word count of 10\u2014were the most successful.\r\n\r\nAt Siege, we follow a general formula for our email subject lines listed out below:\r\n<blockquote>[REASON] for [NAME]: [GRAB ATTENTION]<\/blockquote>\r\nThe \u201creason you\u2019re reaching out\u201d section is in reference to what you\u2019re promoting or asking for. For example, if you\u2019re reaching out to schedule a meeting your email subject line would look a lot like this:\r\n<blockquote>Meeting for Kiera: Influencer marketing strategy<\/blockquote>\r\nIf you\u2019re reaching out to share a guide your company just created you would write:\r\n<blockquote>Guide for Jarrod: 7 ways to grow your business today<\/blockquote>\r\nPretty straightforward, right?\r\n\r\nThe next section is a bit trickier. You\u2019ll want to summarize the reason you\u2019re reaching out in a thought-provoking, yet concise manner. Are you launching a new <a href=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/services\/copywriting\">copywriting service<\/a>? Promoting your new product? Summarize why you\u2019re reaching out in seven words or less.\r\n\r\nFor example, if you\u2019re launching a new inventory management software that aids in preventing employee theft, your subject line could look something like this:\r\n<blockquote>Resource for Trish: How to prevent employee theft<\/blockquote>\r\nWhile this is a sales email subject line, it doesn\u2019t feel like one right away. Instead, it simply feels like you\u2019re sharing a resource targeting a pain point a lot of business owners face. Prospects are more likely to open an email with a good subject line that doesn\u2019t feel too salesy, but instead is conversational and helpful to them.\r\n\r\nEvery email you send should have a carefully crafted subject line that is made relevant to the specific person or site you\u2019re reaching out to. Read on for 45 successful subject line examples from the Siege team themselves.\r\n\r\n<a name=\"personalized\"><\/a>\r\n<h2>Personalized Subject Lines<\/h2>\r\nThe worst kinds of subject lines are the ones that feel automated. You want the prospect reading your email to think you\u2019re an actual living, breathing human\u2014not a bot.\r\n\r\nJust like your email template, your subject line should be personalized. The easiest way to do this is to use the prospect\u2019s name. When sifting through a full email box, people are more likely to stop on subject lines that include their name. If you can\u2019t find their name, use their company or product name. If you have a mutual connection with your prospect, make sure to include that as well.\r\n\r\nThe next way to personalize your subject line is to play into your prospect\u2019s ego. Did they just publish a book? Launch a new website? Write an interesting article? Mention that in your subject line. It will make them feel important and they\u2019ll be appreciative you did your research beforehand.\r\n\r\n<img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-21777\" src=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/personalized-subject-lines.png\" alt=\"personalized subject line example\" width=\"1400\" height=\"515\" \/>\r\n\r\nHere are some examples of personalized email subject lines:\r\n<ul>\r\n \t<li>Congratulations on [Event]!<\/li>\r\n \t<li>[First Name], do you have 5 mins?<\/li>\r\n \t<li>[First Name], here\u2019s how you can crush Q3 goals<\/li>\r\n \t<li>[First Name], have you been taking care of your mental health?<\/li>\r\n \t<li>[First Name], I had a question about your recent article<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n<a name=\"questions\"><\/a>\r\n<h2>Subject Lines That Ask Questions<\/h2>\r\nA great way to entice a prospect to open your email is to ask them a thought-provoking question. Not only should your question make the reader think, but it should also be relevant and pique their interest.\r\n\r\nFor example, if you\u2019re pitching a business you know has moved to remote work, consider asking them a question on how it\u2019s going.

Take the time to craft a thoughtful subject line just like you would a <a href=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/creation\/blog-title-examples\">blog post title<\/a>. Just like blog titles, creative subject lines are crucial to increasing your CTR.\r\n\r\nWhile the type of cold emails we send may be different from your needs, there are some core themes you can apply to your project:\r\n<h3>Make it Timely<\/h3>\r\nTo make your email stand out in an inbox, tie it to a current event, month or holiday. Whether that be Christmas or the start of tax season, leveraging current events can make your email feel more relevant and personal.\r\n\r\nIt\u2019s always important to be mindful of what is going on in the world and what might be going on in your prospect\u2019s personal life. For example, if you know your prospect\u2019s business was hit hard by the <a href=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/marketing\/covid-19-outreach-tips\">COVID-19 pandemic<\/a>, consider reaching out to someone else who may not have so much on their plate.\r\n<h3>Make it Personal<\/h3>\r\nPersonalized email subject lines have been proven to boost open rates. Including someone\u2019s name is a great place to start, however, the more personalization you can add the better. Consider what may be going on in their life. Did they just start a new job? Launch a new product? Reference that in your sales subject line and use casual language to encourage more open rates.\r\n<h3>Make it Compelling<\/h3>\r\nJust like you would the title of a book or movie, make your subject line compelling enough that someone has to do a double take. A great way to do this is by evoking an emotion or by debunking a common belief. For example, if you\u2019re promoting your new service, get your foot in the door with a subject line that includes impressive statistics from your launch.\r\n\r\nWhether you\u2019re writing a sales pitch or promoting your new blog, the tips above can help you create a perfectly crafted subject line that is sure to get opened."

    "content": "Simply building a lot of links is no longer good enough.\r\n\r\nFollowing the Penguin update, it no longer works to build links in a vacuum\u2014without thinking critically about the sites you\u2019re earning placements from and whether they make sense for your brand\u2019s backlink profile.\r\n\r\nAs content marketers, we <a href=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/creation\/linkable-asset-ideas\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">brainstorm content<\/a> by mapping it to linkable outreach markets. In the past, we\u2019d brainstorm content using a simple formula: <b>brand area of focus + outreach market.<\/b>\r\n\r\nBut this formula can sometimes lead people in the wrong direction, diluting your brand\u2019s authority by creating content targeted at markets that are not topically relevant for your business or your brand.\r\n\r\n<img class=\"alignnone wp-image-21662 size-large\" src=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/link-relevancy-1-1024x693.png\" alt=\"depiction of link relevancy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"693\" \/>\r\n\r\nIf you\u2019re wondering what your site\u2019s link relevancy looks like\u2014or think past link building strategies may have strayed a bit from your site\u2019s core competency areas\u2014have no fear. The following tips will help you learn how to determine your site\u2019s link relevancy and learn to consistently build links to sites that make the most sense for your business.\r\n\r\nBefore diving in, additional thanks to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/in\/taylorkatherinecovington\">Taylor Covington<\/a> of <a href=\"https:\/\/www.thezebra.com\/\">The Zebra<\/a> team who provided us with relevant data, screen shots and strategic insights to support this post.\r\n\r\n<h2>What is Link Relevance?<\/h2>\r\n\r\nLink relevance is whether or not a hyperlink back to your website comes from another website that topically makes sense for your brand. In the past, many SEOs would acquire links from any site that would link to them. \r\n\r\nGoogle didn't like this\/see this as a true vote for their website, and over time the belief is that they have narrowed in on rewarding links that topically make sense for the company -- like a health blog linking to WebMD, for example.\r\n\r\n<h2>Link Relevancy Vs. Authority<\/h2>\r\nWhile most reasonable people can agree that the most successful link building strategies focus on earning placements from highly relevant, highly authoritative and topically-related sites, content marketers love to ask \u201cBut which aspect is <i>actually <\/i>the most important?\u201d\r\n\r\nThe short answer? It\u2019s nuanced. While we\u2019d all like to see our website featured in the <i>NY Times<\/i>, earning links from topically relevant sites is key to telling Google what your website is about and what queries it should rank for.\r\n\r\n<img class=\"alignnone wp-image-21693 size-large\" src=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/link-relevancy-2-1-1024x969.png\" alt=\"Link building strategy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"969\" \/>\r\n\r\nIf you\u2019re an automotive brand, for example, it\u2019s better to consistently generate placements from relevant auto publications like <i>Car and Driver, <\/i>even if the domain authority of these placements is lower. By building a backlink profile that\u2019s dominated by car and auto sites, you\u2019re telling Google you\u2019re a trusted authority in this space and setting yourself up to rank for the terms most important to your business.\r\n\r\nYou\u2019ll also want to also set goals around what types of sites are too low authority to be worth reaching out to, despite their topical relevance. While link building strategies that take a blended approach are most likely to be sustainable for the long term, when in doubt it\u2019s best to focus manual link building efforts on sites that most closely align with your product offering.\r\n<blockquote>If you wouldn\u2019t be proud to let a friend know of a placement you earned for your brand, it\u2019s best to skip pitching the site.<\/blockquote>\r\n<a href=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/marketing\/qualify-sites-for-link-outreach\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Evaluating prospects critically<\/a> will help you hold yourself\u2014and your team\u2014to a link building practice that makes the most impact.\r\n<h2>How to Determine Link Relevancy<\/h2>\r\nWhile link relevancy is not an exact science, there are a few key principles to make sure your strategy makes sense and that the links you\u2019re earning are truly valuable.\r\n<h3>Analyze Your Current Content Strategy<\/h3>\r\nStart by considering the content you\u2019re creating each month. Do the topics make sense for your business\u2019 objectives or are they targeted at a specific outreach market with less brand relevance?\r\n\r\nIf you are aiming to prioritize link relevancy in a less receptive industry, you\u2019ll likely need to shift your strategy toward content formats that align best with your intended <a href=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/marketing\/multiple-outreach-markets\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">outreach markets<\/a>. We find that data-driven content like surveys is a great way to create content that ties closely to your brand and earns you links from more relevant and authoritative sites.\r\n\r\nFor example, we created a data study for a car rental company that asked Americans how frequently they clean their cars (spoiler: not very often!). Given the brand was a credible authority for this topic and the survey data told a compelling, emotional story, we were able to earn both relevant placements in industry publications\u2014and top tier media coverage.\r\n\r\n<img class=\"alignnone wp-image-21673 size-large\" src=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/link-relevancy-3-1024x314.png\" alt=\"the success method\" width=\"1024\" height=\"314\" \/>\r\n\r\nWhen analyzing your content strategy with link relevancy in mind, your mindset will likely shift from \u201cWhat content topics will earn a lot of links?\u201d to \u201cWhat topics does it make sense for my brand to cover?\u201d We like to use <a href=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/strategy\/leveling-up-success-method\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">the S.U.C.C.E.S. method<\/a> when brainstorming linkable content, and recommend focusing on topics your brand will seem most credible covering when ideating with link relevancy in mind.\r\n<h3>Take a Closer Look at Your Backlink Profile<\/h3>\r\nEven if you feel confident about your overall link building strategy, it can be helpful to get granular with this analysis. You can use Majestic to determine the overall trust flow and topical trust flow scores of your domain.\r\n\r\n<img class=\"alignnone wp-image-21735 size-large\" src=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/link-relevancy-4-3-1024x546.png\" alt=\"majestic topical trust flow\" width=\"1024\" height=\"546\" \/>\r\n<p id=\"caption-attachment-14186\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Screen shot courtesy of <a href=\"https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/in\/taylorkatherinecovington\">Taylor Covington<\/a> of <a href=\"https:\/\/www.thezebra.com\/\">The Zebra<\/a><\/p>\r\n<strong>Topical Trust Flow<\/strong> will show you what type of site Google thinks you are and what areas you\u2019re seen as authoritative. If your link building strategy is on track, this list will align generally with your product or service offering. If you\u2019re a small business lending site, for example, you\u2019ll want the sites you\u2019re earning links from to come primarily from this and related niches.\r\n\r\nWe also recommend looking at <strong>Trust Score<\/strong> to see how trustworthy your site is deemed. This metric predicts how authoritative a page is given the reality that trustworthy sites tend to link out to other trustworthy sites, while more spammy sites are more likely to earn low-quality links.\r\n<h2>How to Earn Highly Relevant Links<\/h2>\r\n<img class=\"alignnone wp-image-21672 size-large\" src=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/link-relevancy-5-1024x410.png\" alt=\"how to earn highly relevant links\" width=\"1024\" height=\"410\" \/>\r\n\r\nOnce you know what types of links you\u2019d like to earn, do you feel confident that you can consistently generate them? Depending on what industry you operate in, it can be challenging to create a content and link building strategy that will allow you to earn highly relevant links. No matter what industry you\u2019re in, you can adjust your strategy\u2014and your expectations\u2014so that you can earn the most relevant links for your business possible.\r\n<h3>1. Know Your Niche<\/h3>\r\nWhen thinking about link relevancy, it\u2019s important to consider whether your company\u2019s topic area aligns with a receptive outreach market. If your brand\u2019s topic areas align well to receptive outreach markets (e.g. tech, business, eco bloggers), you\u2019ll likely have more luck generating a high volume of relevant links MOM. On the flip side, if you\u2019re a finance or insurance brand, it may make sense to focus on a lower link volume, but more relevant and authoritative placements.\r\n\r\nIf you operate in a <a href=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/creation\/content-in-boring-industries\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">less \u201cfun\u201d industry<\/a>, this is important to keep in mind when building your strategy. When there\u2019s not a clear brand and outreach market alignment, we recommend centering your strategy around survey and original data content, as unique or curated data is much more likely to appeal to relevant news sites and other highly authoritative outlets.\r\n\r\nFocusing on outreach markets where you can be an authority will help you earn links that meet both quantity and quality standards.\r\n<h3>2. Prioritize Relevant Anchor Text<\/h3>\r\nWe know you\u2019ve heard this before, but it\u2019s worth repeating. Beyond the links you\u2019re building, the anchor text you\u2019re earning is crucial to how relevant and valuable these links are. We recommend creating guidelines around anchor text that does or does not make sense for the links you\u2019re earning. Opt for branded keywords over less valuable text like \u201cinfographic,\u201d \u201cprintable\u201d or \u201cclick here\u201d to make the most impact.\r\n\r\nOnce you have guidelines established, you can use this list when creating custom copy that you\u2019re sharing with bloggers and site masters to ensure every link you\u2019re earning is as valuable as possible.\r\n<h3>3. Adjust Link Expectations<\/h3>\r\nIf your industry\u2014like many\u2014doesn\u2019t naturally tie to a linkable market, you may need to adjust your expectations in terms of the number of links you\u2019ll generate each month when prioritizing link relevancy. When done right a strategy focused on link relevancy will consistently bring in more useful links.\r\n\r\n<img class=\"alignnone wp-image-21694 size-large\" src=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/link-relevancy-7-1024x305.png\" alt=\"link building strategy spectrum\" width=\"1024\" height=\"305\" \/>\r\n\r\nWe\u2019ve worked with clients to redefine what success looks like for projects, often adjusting link numbers down and DA goals up to reflect a strategy shift toward more targeted and authoritative publications. It\u2019s easy to celebrate this shift in strategy when you remember that the links you\u2019re acquiring will likely have greater domain authority, be more valuable to your brand and bring in more qualified traffic.\r\n<h3>4. Understand Link Velocity<\/h3>\r\nStill on the fence if a strategy shift may be right for your brand? Check how your site\u2019s link velocity compares to competitors. If you\u2019re not trying to catch up to a competitor, you\u2019ll have more flexibility to focus on relevant placements over the sheer number of links earned each month.\r\n\r\n<img class=\"alignnone wp-image-21736 size-large\" src=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/link-relevancy-5-2-1024x610.png\" alt=\"link velocity for finance brands \" width=\"1024\" height=\"610\" \/>\r\n\r\nFor example, if you\u2019re CreditRepair.com (the black line) in the above chart, your link building strategy is a volume game. Whereas if you are NerdWallet (the blue line) or Experian (the orange line), you have a better lead and can prioritize relevancy.\r\n<h2>Quality Over Quantity<\/h2>\r\nWhen in doubt, we recommend looking at potential outreach prospects and links earned with a critical eye. Asking yourself, \u201cWill this link bring qualified traffic to my site?\u201d is an easy way to hold yourself and your team accountable for <a href=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/services\/content-marketing\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">content marketing efforts<\/a>. You\u2019ll also rest easy knowing that focusing on acquiring more relevant links will likely also bring in more engaged, high-value visitors to your site\u2014which should be the end game of any <a href=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/strategy\/benefits-of-content-marketing\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">smart content marketing strategy<\/a>."

    "title": "How to Write an Author Bio [+ 7 Examples]",
    "content": "After Google announced updates to their Quality Raters Guidelines, author bios were the talk of the SEO community. But do they matter?\r\n\r\nIf you run your brand\u2019s blog, you may be wondering if incorporating an author bio or byline makes sense. SEO goals aside, author bylines can be helpful to build a relationship with your readers and grow your audience.\r\n\r\nOur clients will come to us asking if an author bio is a good fit and our answer is: it depends.\r\n<div class=\"video-container\"><iframe src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/ugC1cHIMBgs\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"><span data-mce-type=\"bookmark\" style=\"display: inline-block; width: 0px; overflow: hidden; line-height: 0;\" class=\"mce_SELRES_start\">\ufeff<\/span><\/iframe><\/div>\r\n[subscribe-cta bloglink1=TRUE text1=\"Subscribe to Content &amp; Links\"]\r\n<h2>Does an Author Bio Improve Traffic?<\/h2>\r\nIn short, no. If your <a href=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/services\/content-creation\">blog content is struggling to rank<\/a>, slapping an author bio on the post won\u2019t magically get it <a href=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/conversation\/updating-our-traffic-ebook\">more traffic<\/a>.\r\n\r\nIn fact, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.searchenginejournal.com\/author-biography-google-ranking\/312175\/#close\">John Mueller of Google<\/a> has shared that author bios specifically do not impact their Quality Raters Guidelines, positively or negatively. Here is a direct quote:\r\n\r\n<img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-21403\" src=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/08\/john-mueller-qoute-headshot.png\" alt=\"john mueller EAT quote\" width=\"1400\" height=\"838\" \/>\r\n\r\nIn summary, you should ask yourself these questions first:\r\n<ul>\r\n \t<li>Do I already have an established readership where associating my content with a person would help?<\/li>\r\n \t<li>Do I have <a href=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/creation\/content-creator\">credible content creators<\/a> on my team I can already point to?<\/li>\r\n \t<li>Is my industry in a sensitive YMYL topic area, such as medicine or finance, where having a real person associated with posts helps?<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\nIf you answered \u201cyes\u201d to any or all of these questions, it may be worth creating an author bio.\r\n<h2>3 Author Bio Options<\/h2>\r\nWhen we\u2019ve designed author bios for our clients, we look at three core options:\r\n<ol>\r\n \t<li>Author name only<\/li>\r\n \t<li>Name + headshot only<\/li>\r\n \t<li>Full bio (name, headshot, biography and more)<\/li>\r\n<\/ol>\r\nDepending on your branding and preferences, you can go with any combination of the above. Again, since author bios don\u2019t directly influence rankings, no need to stress over if including a staff photo will make or break your chances.\r\n\r\nWhichever option you choose, make sure your author bio clicks through to a full page of their contributions. While we recommend noindexing these pages, it\u2019s still nice for your readers to explore other articles that person wrote, further cementing your dedicated readership.\r\n<h2>Which Author Bio Is Right For Me?<\/h2>\r\nWith all the options above to choose from, you may be unsure where exactly to start. In the end, it\u2019s less about one format being stronger than another, rather which matches your business needs.\r\n<h3>Option 1: General Company Byline<\/h3>\r\nA common question we get is, \u201cWhat happens if the author leaves the company?\u201d Are you suddenly losing all \u201cequity\u201d you built with that person? Or what if senior leadership doesn\u2019t have time to post content? Is it fair to have the content team write for the blog, but the byline goes to someone else?\r\n\r\nOne popular route is using your brand name as the byline. This is a simple solution if you want an author bio, but you don\u2019t currently have the staff resources to assign posts to a particular person.\r\n\r\nThe \u201ccon\u201d to this approach is that you risk a blogroll looking very redundant. And how well is that author bio serving you if it\u2019s all the same \u201cCOMPANY NAME\u201d listed 30 times in a row? Your users (and Google) already know it\u2019s your brand\u2019s content\u2014they\u2019re on your site!\r\n\r\nSo while this option won\u2019t hurt anything, how much is it helping?\r\n<h3>Option 2: Embrace Company Bios<\/h3>\r\nOn the flip side, if you have a content team there is no reason not to embrace authorship across the blog. This works best when you have a diverse and large (think 3+ people) team of writers. That way, if there is turnover or changes in position, your readership has established relationships with multiple people on your team.\r\n\r\nA company that does a great job of this is Buffer, who has upwards of five or more team members contributing to the blog at any given time. What is nice about <a href=\"https:\/\/buffer.com\/resources\/\">Buffer<\/a> is that content creation is clearly part of their ethos\u2014everyone from HR to marketing to the CEO is contributing.\r\n\r\nThis obviously takes time to build and Buffer has been working on their blog content since their start. If this quality is something you aspire to, author bios won\u2019t be the only step in your process.\r\n<h3>Option 3: Ghostwriting<\/h3>\r\nAs mentioned earlier, let\u2019s say you have a small content team or you outsource a good amount of content. I don\u2019t frown upon ghostwriting (if I did, I\u2019d be out of a job). Having copywriters or freelance writers write for your business\u2014and attributing that content to a more senior team member\u2014is completely normal in this business.\r\n\r\nWe\u2019ll have clients ask if they should have the company bio or have it be one of our team members and my answer is usually: what are you most comfortable with? We want to match whatever brand our client wants to reflect and if they want that level of transparency with their readership, then we follow their lead.\r\n\r\nThe only scenario where ghostwriting may not be a fit (and even in this case, probably still a small issue) is if you are a singular consultant or thought leader. Again, this won\u2019t exactly get you penalized by Google and I\u2019d argue most readers won\u2019t care, as long as it\u2019s still quality writing and compensation is fair.\r\n<h3>Option 4: \u201cReviewed By\u201d Byline<\/h3>\r\nAnother option that is popping up in the health and wellness space is a \u201creviewed\u201d or \u201cfact checked\u201d by byline. This can either show two bylines (the original writer and the editor) or just the editor as a way of communicating to the reader that multiple people were involved in the creation of the content.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"https:\/\/www.verywellfit.com\/zinc-supplements-for-strength-and-muscle-3498781\">Verywell Fit<\/a> is a great example of balancing two bylines at once, whereas <a href=\"https:\/\/www.whattoexpect.com\/pregnancy\/week-by-week\/weeks-1-and-2.aspx\">What To Expect<\/a> shows just a singular byline at the end of their content.\r\n<h3>Option 5: No Author Bio<\/h3>\r\nAnd the final option: just don\u2019t do it! We\u2019ve talked to many clients who spent time debating author bios, trying to get leadership buy in and, ultimately, deciding it wasn\u2019t the right fit at that time. That\u2019s a perfectly fine decision and worth returning to annually if your needs or team changes.\r\n<h2>How to Write an Author Bio<\/h2>\r\nIf you\u2019ve picked the \u201cfull bio\u201d option, the next step will be writing your actual bio. No need to fret, this task should only take an hour of your time. At Siege, we recommend the following if it\u2019s your first time writing a bio:\r\n<h3>Write In the Third Person<\/h3>\r\nInstead of using \u201cI\u201d and \u201cme\u201d statements, write using the third person. It may sound weird to say out loud, but will make more sense in this context.\r\n<h3>2-3 Sentences Max<\/h3>\r\nThis isn\u2019t the time to start writing your actual autobiography. Keep your bio short and sweet. The standard framework to follow is:\r\n<ul>\r\n \t<li>1 sentence about your current job title + job function<\/li>\r\n \t<li>1 sentence about your experience<\/li>\r\n \t<li>1 \u201cfun\u201d sentence (pets, hobbies, favorite food, etc.)<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n<h3>Include Social Media Handles<\/h3>\r\nEncourage follows by sharing any relevant social media handles. Just make sure your accounts are actually fit for people to follow professionally.\r\n<h3>Include a Link to Your Company<\/h3>\r\nAn author bio is also a great way to encourage relevant backlinks as many people will copy and paste that copy. That said, most guest posting sets these links as nofollow\u2014although could still bring in the occasional link.\r\n<h3>Highlight Your Expertise<\/h3>\r\nDon\u2019t be afraid to toot your own horn. In one quick sentence, summarize why you are the expert on the topic you\u2019re writing about. Include things like years of experience, published works, degrees and\/or titles, conference appearances, media coverage or past jobs.\r\n<h3>Don\u2019t Shy Away from Personality<\/h3>\r\nReading a quirky bio at the end of an article can make a lasting impression and encourage a future share or follow. Highlight your personality with your favorite activity or a funny joke. My colleague, Erikas Chesonis, is a perfect example over on our <a href=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/creation\/about-us-page-examples\">About page<\/a>:\r\n\r\n<img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-21394\" src=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/08\/erikas-bio.png\" alt=\"Siege Media bio\" width=\"1401\" height=\"648\" \/>\r\n<h2>\u201cAbout the Author\u201d Template<\/h2>\r\nIf you\u2019re still stuck on what to write, here\u2019s a simple template to follow:\r\n<blockquote>[FIRST NAME LAST NAME] is [TITLE] at [COMPANY], [JOB ROLE]. [EXPLANATION OF EXPERTISE]. [FUN SENTENCE].<\/blockquote>\r\nAnd here is an example of the template in action:\r\n<blockquote>Caroline Gilbert is Director of Marketing at Siege Media where she has spent 5+ years growing client accounts. She has experience ranking content for keywords ranging from 1,000 - 10,000+ in monthly search volume. You can find her on the weekends enjoying the San Diego beaches and walking her dog.<\/blockquote>\r\n<h2>7 Creative Author Bio Examples<\/h2>\r\nIf you\u2019re sold on the author bio route, nothing hurts my eyes more than a poorly formatted one. Get some inspiration from these well crafted bios below:\r\n<h3>1. Uniformly Branded: G2<\/h3>\r\n<img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-21395\" src=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/08\/g2-bio.png\" alt=\"G2 author bio\" width=\"1401\" height=\"877\" \/>\r\n\r\n<a href=\"https:\/\/learn.g2.com\/\">G2<\/a> has all their company headshots on a bright red background, which does double duty as a way to uniformly brand everyone at the company and draw attention to the author bio.\r\n<h3>2. Author Name + Headshot: Buffer<\/h3>\r\n<img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-21396\" src=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/08\/buffer-bio.png\" alt=\"Buffer author bio\" width=\"1401\" height=\"751\" \/>\r\n\r\n<a href=\"https:\/\/buffer.com\/resources\/buying-out-investors\/\">Buffer<\/a> does a solid job balancing a few different features in a small space. I especially like their subtle \u201cread time\u201d glasses icon and the subtle circle outline to their headshots.\r\n<h3>3. Author Name Only: Makespace<\/h3>\r\n<img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-21397\" src=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/08\/makespace-bio.png\" alt=\"Makespace author bio\" width=\"1401\" height=\"857\" \/>\r\n\r\nWhile on its own the <a href=\"https:\/\/makespace.com\/blog\/posts\/moving-packing-tips\/\">Makespace<\/a> author bio is a simple first and last name, it balances nicely with the larger hero image and <a href=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/creation\/blog-title-examples\">blog title<\/a>.\r\n<h3>4. Creative Spin: Signal v. Noise<\/h3>\r\n<img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-21398\" src=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/08\/signalvnoise-bio.png\" alt=\"Signal v Noise author bio\" width=\"1401\" height=\"649\" \/>\r\n\r\nWho said an author bio had to have a headshot? For the camera shy or fully remote team (where getting high quality, uniform images can be tough), try illustrating everyone as a creative way to add a face to the name like <a href=\"https:\/\/m.signalvnoise.com\/author\/jason-fried\/\">Signal v. Noise<\/a>.\r\n<h3>5. Full Bio: Fundera<\/h3>\r\n<img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-21399\" src=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/08\/fundera-bio.png\" alt=\"Fundera author bio\" width=\"1401\" height=\"876\" \/>\r\n\r\nIf you opt for a full bio with lots of text and information, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.fundera.com\/blog\/do-i-need-an-llc\">Fundera<\/a> does a good job at including a small byline at the top and full information at the bottom so as to not busy up the top of the post.\r\n<h3>6. \u201cEdited By\u201d: Verywell Fit<\/h3>\r\n<img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-21400\" src=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/08\/verywellfit-bio.png\" alt=\"Verywell Fit author bio\" width=\"1401\" height=\"836\" \/>\r\n\r\n<a href=\"https:\/\/www.verywellfit.com\/zinc-supplements-for-strength-and-muscle-3498781\">Verywell Fit<\/a> takes their byline a step further by having the names show a pop up box on hover with each contributor\u2019s full bio. This is especially smart in health &amp; wellness so a reader can better understand each person\u2019s credentials.\r\n<h3>7. Personality: Rover<\/h3>\r\n<img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-21401\" src=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/08\/rover-bio.png\" alt=\"Rover author bio\" width=\"1401\" height=\"596\" \/>\r\n\r\nEncourage employees to have some fun with their bio copy, like including their favorite hobbies. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.rover.com\/blog\/long-can-leave-dog-alone\/\">Rover<\/a> does a great job of showcasing their team\u2019s love for their animals and their special quirks.\r\n<h2>EAT Alternatives to an Author Bio<\/h2>\r\nInstead of an author bio, there may be other content factors you should be evaluating instead that have an even greater impact on EAT. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.pathinteractive.com\/blog\/seo\/what-does-it-mean-to-have-good-e-a-t\/\">This study by Lily Ray<\/a> points out the following:\r\n<ul>\r\n \t<li>Having a clearly stated editorial policy if your business falls in <a href=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/seo\/ymyl\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">YMYL categories<\/a> (we really love <a href=\"https:\/\/themarkup.org\/allstates-algorithm\/2020\/02\/25\/show-your-work-car-insurance-suckers-list\">this example<\/a> from The Markup)<\/li>\r\n \t<li>Investigating poorly written or optimized CTAs on your blog<\/li>\r\n \t<li>Reviewing your external linking policy and ensuring your citations are accurate<\/li>\r\n \t<li>Include an awards, accolades, \u201cused by\u201d or \u201cfeatured in\u201d bar on your site<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n<img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-21404\" src=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/08\/lily-ray-qoute-headshot.png\" alt=\"Lily Ray EAT quote\" width=\"1400\" height=\"838\" \/>\r\n<h2>Written By: Me<\/h2>\r\nHopefully this puts the author bios debate to bed as well as provides you with some options that can fit your team and content goals. Remember: whichever option you choose make sure it\u2019s one you\u2019re confident you can maintain for many years. With an author bio set up, time for the hard part\u2014actually <a href=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/creation\/how-to-write-a-good-blog-post\">developing your content<\/a>."

    "title": "10 Benefits of Content Marketing You Can\u2019t Ignore",
    "content": "So you\u2019re interested in content marketing, but not totally sold yet?\r\n\r\nMaybe you\u2019ve seen your competitors dominate the SERPs overnight, or maybe you just started a company and aren\u2019t sure where to start.\r\n\r\nWe can assure you that content marketing isn\u2019t just a buzzword. It\u2019s more than just pressing publish over and over again. It\u2019s a strategic and fundamental part of growing your brand online.\r\n\r\nOK, but why is it important? SEO-driven content marketing ensures that your brand doesn\u2019t get lost in the noise. Content, when done right, can make you stand out from the over <a href=\"https:\/\/www.internetlivestats.com\/total-number-of-websites\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">1.5 billion websites online<\/a>. At Siege, we\u2019ve been able to <a href=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/work\/finance-link-building-study\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">increase traffic by 413%<\/a> and build a 110-person agency all based on the benefits of SEO-focused content marketing.\r\n\r\nStill not convinced? Here are 10 of the biggest benefits of content marketing you can\u2019t ignore.\r\n<h2>1. It Puts Eyes On Your Business<\/h2>\r\nContent marketing is one of the easiest ways to reach a large number of people. While banner ads can bring attention to your business, SEO-driven content marketing allows you to put your brand in front of a large audience in a way that is helpful to them.\r\n\r\nBut, how? Google loves content and Google will reward quality content by increasing your rankings. If you\u2019re creating consistent, quality content that ranks, the more eyes are going to be on your business.\r\n\r\nFor example, say you create a blog on the best bedroom styling ideas with an <a href=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/creation\/best-infographics\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">infographic<\/a> and video to accompany it. You can then promote that blog and shareable via social media, email marketing, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/channel\/UChWtFVFpJqaGd8E2zCI1HUA\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">YouTube<\/a> and <a href=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/marketing\/covid-19-outreach-tips\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">outreach<\/a>. That one piece of content will speak to a multitude of audiences on all of your different platforms.\r\n\r\nInfographics and videos are just the tip of the iceberg. If you're looking for more content inspiration, visit our post on <a href=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/strategy\/content-marketing-examples\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">examples of content marketing<\/a> in action.\r\n<h2>2. It Positions You as an Authority<\/h2>\r\nBrand authority could be the reason someone decides to buy your product or not. You can start building your brand\u2019s authority through content marketing. Ask yourself what questions your target audience has and why. Then, build content around it.\r\n\r\nFor example, if you\u2019re in the career space, you\u2019re likely going to want to position yourself as a thought leader and resource for your customer\u2019s career-related questions. Indeed does a great job of this.\r\n\r\n<img class=\"alignnone wp-image-21298 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/08\/1-indeed.png\" alt=\"graphic that shows Indeed's career guide\" width=\"1400\" height=\"1276\" \/>\r\n\r\nRight away they position themself as a \u201cCareer Guide.\u201d This lets readers know what to expect when visiting their blog. They then break their content up into five prominent sections that contain important keywords in their space. From there, they create purposeful content around it.\r\n\r\nWhen done correctly, content marketing can help you dominate your industry space. When a brand\u2019s site architecture is smart and the information they\u2019re delivering is done so efficiently, users are more likely to run to them for information and Google is more likely to reward content that is relevant to the brand and their audience.\r\n<h2>3. It Builds Trust With Your Audience<\/h2>\r\nWhen your customers have a question you want them to look to you. Content marketing can help you do that by creating content around common customer questions.\r\n\r\nLet\u2019s take a look at <a href=\"https:\/\/blog.mint.com\/\">Mint\u2019s blog<\/a>. They do a great job of creating relevant, scannable content around common questions in the credit industry.\r\n\r\n<img class=\"alignnone wp-image-21315 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/08\/2-mint-scroll.gif\" alt=\"Mint's blog\" width=\"700\" height=\"445\" \/>\r\n\r\nBy using content marketing to create a wide variety of well-designed answer posts that really solve for the user\u2019s needs, Mint is likely to be perceived as more competent overall.\r\n\r\nWith a line-up of easy to understand content that solves problems, users are likely to trust them to deliver their product or service just as effectively\u2014especially compared to a competitor whose attempts to solve for those queries are sloppy or poorly designed.\r\n<h2>4. It Educates Your Customers<\/h2>\r\nIf you have a confusing product or service, what better way to educate your potential customers than to create a blog about it? In the wise words of Francis Bacon, \u201cknowledge is power.\u201d To give your customers some of that knowledge is a huge value-add\u2014or as we like to call it at Siege, a \u201ccoffee and cake\u201d moment.\r\n\r\nContent marketing is a way to meet people on a common level. Any opportunity you have to educate your customers on your topic or industry pushes them further and further down the buyer funnel.\r\n\r\n<img class=\"alignnone wp-image-21300 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/08\/3-stages.png\" alt=\"graphic of the buyer funnel\" width=\"1400\" height=\"986\" \/>\r\n\r\nI like to think of content marketing as walking your customers through the buyer\u2019s journey. If you sell wedding dresses, you can bring awareness to your brand by first creating a top-funnel blog post around wedding trends in 2020. You can follow that blog up with an article on different wedding dress styles for every theme (linking to relevant dresses on your site).\r\n\r\nAnd finally, you can meet your customers in the decision stage by creating a blog post on how to choose the perfect wedding dress. This lower-funnel topic provides your customer with the insight they need to make an educated <a href=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/seo\/e-commerce\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">purchasing decision<\/a>.\r\n\r\nNot only is this content educating existing customers, <strong>but new ones as well<\/strong>. And just like that, you have another happy customer.\r\n<h2>5. It Drives Traffic to High-Value Pages<\/h2>\r\nWhen conducting <a href=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/seo\/kwr-emerging-trends\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">keyword research<\/a>, you ideally want to target keywords that support the high-value product pages on your site\u2014or as we like to call them at Siege \u201cmoney pages.\u201d\r\n\r\nThese are the product pages on your site that bring in the big bucks. Content marketing can help you drive traffic to these pages.\r\n\r\nFor example, let\u2019s say you\u2019re a flower delivery company. If you create a blog post around the best flower arrangements for Mother\u2019s Day and link to different products on your site, not only are you bringing awareness to these pages, but your customers are likely to visit those pages as well.\r\n\r\nLinking to your money pages within relevant content is also a great way to tell search engines what your product pages are all about. Search engines view links as a good signal that your content was useful. It can also help boost your rankings if your anchor text is used correctly.\r\n<h2>6. It Drives Conversions<\/h2>\r\nYes, content marketing can increase your traffic, but that traffic is going to mean a lot more to your business if it converts. Just creating one piece of evergreen content isn\u2019t going to cut it. Consistently posting relevant content can drive way more conversions than any ad placement will.\r\n\r\nWhy? That content doesn\u2019t go away. It lives on your website and it\u2019s a lot more useful to the reader than a pop-up ad.\r\n\r\n<img class=\"alignnone wp-image-21301 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/08\/4-content.png\" alt=\"graphic showing how content drives traffic and conversions\" width=\"1400\" height=\"1120\" \/>\r\n\r\nThe more consistent you are, the more eyes are going to be on your business, the better you\u2019re going to rank and the more conversions you\u2019re going to see.\r\n<h2>7. It Opens Channels of Communication<\/h2>\r\nOnce you publish a blog, you can then promote it on your plethora of social channels. As your post gains traction and people share your content online, you can then begin connecting with the readers that engaged with your post. This gives you the opportunity to have real conversations with your customers. It also allows you to take a peek into their minds and really understand who they are.\r\n\r\nTake a look at the comments on your post. Were there additional questions? Positive feedback? You can use this information to shape your following content pieces.\r\n\r\nIf a piece of content you created raised questions, create a follow-up blog answering those questions. If you received a lot of praise for a recent article, consider following a similar content format going forward.\r\n\r\n<strong>Content marketing creates a direct line of communication with your customers, through a variety of mediums.<\/strong> When your customers have a question, you\u2019re there to answer it right away.\r\n\r\nContent marketing also helps you control the conversation. Being able to educate your customer on your product or service before they make their purchasing decision is invaluable.\r\n<h2>8. It's Cost-Effective<\/h2>\r\nIf you\u2019ve been throwing money at paid search and social media marketing, it\u2019s time to switch up your strategy. According to <a href=\"https:\/\/blockthrough.com\/2020\/02\/06\/2020-adblock-report-3\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Blockthrough\u2019s 2020 PaigeFair Adblock report<\/a>, over 763 million devices globally block ads. The days of pop-up ads and traditional marketing are over. Consumers want to feel a connection with a brand, and that\u2019s where content marketing comes in.\r\n\r\n<img class=\"alignnone wp-image-21302 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/08\/5-adblock.png\" alt=\"graphic showing over 763 million devices globally block ads\" width=\"1400\" height=\"462\" \/>\r\n\r\nThe best thing about content marketing? It costs a lot less than paying for ad placements. In fact, content marketing costs <a href=\"https:\/\/www.demandmetric.com\/content\/content-marketing-infographic\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">62% less than outbound marketing<\/a> (while generating three times as many leads). So not only are you getting more bang for your buck, but you\u2019re helping your customers and cultivating trust at the same time.\r\n<h2>9. It Works for Every Industry<\/h2>\r\nOne of the best things about content marketing is how inclusive it is. Many assume content marketing will only work for big brands or lifestyle publications. However, that could not be further from the truth. No matter how uninteresting or complicated you think your product or company is, I promise you content marketing can help.\r\n\r\nJust look at how we were able to <strong>grow a flower delivery service\u2019s organic traffic by 200% in over 4 years<\/strong>.\r\n\r\n<img class=\"alignnone wp-image-21303 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/08\/6-AHREFs.png\" alt=\"screenshot from AHREFs showing how we grew organic traffic by 200% in over 4 years.\" width=\"1400\" height=\"597\" \/>\r\n\r\nBy creating high-quality content that is interesting to users, we were able to generate more than 1150 referring domains to their site. We also created mid- and bottom-funnel content that the brand was able to rank for easily in order to drive traffic and conversions.\r\n\r\nSo whether you own a truck driving company or just started your own online cookie delivery service, content marketing is relevant for any industry and is critical in helping you stand out online.\r\n<h2>10. It Provides Continuous ROI<\/h2>\r\nMy favorite thing about content marketing is the success you\u2019ll see long-term. Just last year <a href=\"https:\/\/blog.hubspot.com\/marketing\/blogging-frequency-benchmarks?_ga=2.197564457.721249430.1495813170-2087292262.1486062258\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Hubspot found that<\/a> marketers who prioritize content marketing efforts are 13 times more likely to see positive ROI.\r\n\r\nEvery piece of valuable content you publish has the potential to bring in <strong>hundreds of thousands of visitors every month<\/strong>.\r\n\r\nLet\u2019s say you write a blog post on different bed sizes. The keyword \u201cbed sizes\u201d has a monthly search volume of 100,000. If you secure the number one spot for that keyword and the SERP has little volatility, you can expect to see an additional thousands of people viewing your website month over month.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the increase in traffic you\u2019ll see, you\u2019ll also watch your backlink profile grow.\r\n\r\nFor example, check out <a href=\"https:\/\/www.nextiva.com\/blog\/customer-service-statistics.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">this piece<\/a> we created for Nextiva. By targeting the keyword \u201ccustomer service statistics,\u201d we were able to <strong>grow their backlink profile by 700+ links<\/strong>.\r\n\r\n<img class=\"alignnone wp-image-21304 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/08\/7-stats-and-trends.png\" alt=\"screenshot from AHREFs showing 700+ backlinks\" width=\"1400\" height=\"360\" \/>\r\n\r\nWe were able to achieve this by identifying a high-value keyword with a high \u201clink-to-view-ratio.\u201d In other words, targeting a search term that people explicitly look to link to. Each of these links has the potential to drive more traffic to your site and those links will continue to stack up over time.\r\n<h2>Content Marketing Drawbacks<\/h2>\r\nDespite the content marketing benefits listed above, there are a few drawbacks you should consider.\r\n<ul>\r\n \t<li><strong>Upfront cost<\/strong>: Initially, content marketing can feel like a big expense \u2014 especially if you don\u2019t have a team. Without a team, you\u2019ll need to consider hiring a <a href=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">content marketing agency<\/a>, or a skilled group of designers, copywriters, videographers and more.<\/li>\r\n \t<li><strong>Longer-term spend<\/strong>: One of the biggest downfalls of content marketing is the time it can take to see results. Content marketing is a long game and it can sometimes take months to see the results you're after.<\/li>\r\n \t<li><strong>It can be time-consuming<\/strong>: In order to create a piece of quality content that ranks, you need to put in the work. That means really understanding your customer\u2019s questions and needs. You\u2019ll need to collect data, do research, get creative and strategic all while presenting your content in a way that is easily digestible.<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n<h2>Moral of the Story: Content Marketing is Effective<\/h2>\r\nContent marketing is one of the strongest forms of digital marketing out there. From building trust with your audience online to providing continuous ROI, there are so many advantages to content marketing that cannot be ignored.\r\n\r\nLike I said earlier, content marketing is more than pressing publish. You need to consistently create great content that works in tandem with a <a href=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/strategy\/coronavirus-content-marketing\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">solid content marketing strategy<\/a>. With a solid content marketing campaign, you\u2019ll begin to build customer relationships and watch your site traffic and conversion rate grow.\r\n\r\nNot sure where to start?

Within these categories, you\u2019ll find opportunities for design, photography, videography and content writing jobs. The pros and cons of each vary greatly by where you work but they should give you a general idea.\r\n<h3>Freelance Content Creator<\/h3>\r\nFreelance content creation work is great for those who value their freedom over a steady flow of work and income. Successful freelancers can generate more than enough business for themselves, so don\u2019t be discouraged if this is your desired path. Freelancers can do work for others or find ways to promote their own media channels and monetize them for a living (like social media influencers).\r\n<ul>\r\n \t<li><strong>Pros<\/strong>: Schedule flexibility, content variety, set your own prices<\/li>\r\n \t<li><strong>Cons<\/strong>: No guaranteed income, no employee benefits<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n<h3>In-House Content Creation<\/h3>\r\nIn-house content teams work for one company or an umbrella organization that offers stable income and benefits. You\u2019ll likely be focusing on one industry only but if you land a role in an industry you love, it could be a great fit.\r\n<ul>\r\n \t<li><strong>Pros<\/strong>: Greater control over <a href=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/seo\/content-strategy\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">content strategy<\/a>, closer collaboration with other marketing teams<\/li>\r\n \t<li><strong>Cons<\/strong>: Less content variety, less potential for creativity<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n<h3>Content Creation Agency<\/h3>\r\nAgency work provides the opportunity to work on a wide range of clients and improve your skill set with the stability and benefits of a salary job. Content agencies can be too fast-paced for some but others thrive in a more dynamic environment.\r\n<ul>\r\n \t<li><strong>Pros<\/strong>: Solid income stream, wide variety of content and clients<\/li>\r\n \t<li><b>Cons<\/b>: Fast-paced, can be more competitive<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n<h2 id=\"process\">How to Become a Content Creator<\/h2>\r\n<img class=\"alignnone wp-image-21150 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/07\/how-to-become-a-content-creator.png\" alt=\"6 steps to become a content creator: Educate Yourself, Find Your Expertise and Niche, Soak Up Experiences and New Challenges, Create and Maintain Your Own Brand, Network Authentically, Continue Learning\" width=\"1400\" height=\"921\" \/>\r\n\r\nThere are many paths to become a digital content creator. While most agencies and in-house positions require relevant marketing, writing or design degrees, and years of experience, there are entry-level positions that help you get your foot in the door.\r\n\r\nFreelancers need less experience or degrees to get started but should build up their portfolio and resume as well as educate themselves on techniques and trends in order to garner greater work at higher rates. Finding your niche or specialization is the best way to advance your career and build up a rapport in your desired industry.\r\n\r\nWhile everyone\u2019s journey is different, below are some of the most common ways to become a content creator. Check out our SiegeLearn <a href=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/courses\/content-marketing\">online content marketing course<\/a> for tailored lessons to help you get started or to build upon your skill set.\r\n<h3>1. Educate Yourself<\/h3>\r\n<strong>Degree or Certificate <\/strong>\r\nMany universities have expanded their programs into digital marketing and content creation emphases. Since content creation is a multi-faceted job, it\u2019s helpful to have an idea of the type of content creation you\u2019d like to do before committing to a program.\r\n\r\nSome paths are more clear, like design and production but content writing and management can be less clear. Some popular degrees mentioned in content writing position descriptions include:\r\n<ul>\r\n \t<li>Marketing<\/li>\r\n \t<li>Public Relations<\/li>\r\n \t<li>Business<\/li>\r\n \t<li>Journalism<\/li>\r\n \t<li>English<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\nIf you\u2019re interested in technical writing, clients are looking for experience in that field plus the writing skills to convey what you know\u2014for example, this could look like a degree or work experience in biology plus a technical writing certificate or a portfolio of existing published work.\r\n\r\n<strong>Internships<\/strong>\r\nPaid and unpaid internships are a great way to break into the content production business. Internships can sometimes lead to full-time positions and at the very least, help you build experience and references for your resume.\r\n\r\n<strong>Self-Taught<\/strong>\r\nThe internet hosts a vast library of resources and courses that you can use to educate yourself and level up your skills. Try the free <a href=\"https:\/\/analytics.google.com\/analytics\/academy\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Google Analytics Certification<\/a> course and the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.skillshare.com\/classes\/Become-a-Better-Blogger-Content-Planning\/1670991637\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Udemy: Become a Better Blogger<\/a> course to help you get started.\r\n<h3>2. Find Your Expertise and Niche<\/h3>\r\nFinding your expertise is especially important for freelancers as you\u2019ll want to set yourself apart. Are you interested in writing about a certain industry, technical SEO, content marketing, editing or something else?\r\n\r\nFor those looking to go the in-house or agency route, you can use your work experience to help find your expertise, especially if it\u2019s early on in your career. To advance your career and gain new opportunities you should demonstrate your unique value through your expertise or niche skills.\r\n<h3>3. Soak Up Experiences and New Challenges<\/h3>\r\nThis tip is intimately tied to finding your niche. While working, interning or networking, stay aware of what\u2019s happening around you. Take on opportunities that arise, you may find a whole new facet of content creation that you love or pick up valuable skills that you can leverage elsewhere. Some additional skills that are useful to content creators outside of the skills of writing and arts include:\r\n<ul>\r\n \t<li><a href=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/services\/seo\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Technical SEO<\/a><\/li>\r\n \t<li>HTML and other developer basics<\/li>\r\n \t<li>Tracking conversions and goals<\/li>\r\n \t<li>Improving your communication skills<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n<h3>4. Create and Maintain Your Own Brand<\/h3>\r\nPersonal branding isn\u2019t only for influencers. Maintaining a blog, vlog, podcast or social media account to showcase your personal expertise can help build your authority and foster new business opportunities. The same practices that you would recommend to a client also apply to you:\r\n<ol>\r\n \t<li>Research and see what\u2019s already out there<\/li>\r\n \t<li>Cultivate your own voice and style<\/li>\r\n \t<li>Focus in on your expertise<\/li>\r\n \t<li>Create content with a specific audience member in mind<\/li>\r\n \t<li>Post at a consistent rate<\/li>\r\n \t<li>Engage with the community<\/li>\r\n<\/ol>\r\nAt the very minimum, you should have an up-to-date LinkedIn profile but a Twitter account is also recommended.\r\n<h3>5. Network Authentically<\/h3>\r\nOrganic connections may come as a result of building your personal brand but it\u2019s also important to seek out networking opportunities. Online and in-person networking events and industry conferences are another great way to engage. There are also plenty of online groups on Facebook and Twitter that you can join to connect with like minded individuals.\r\n\r\nWhen engaging with your peers, make sure it\u2019s authentic. Inauthentic compliments are easy to spot and are not well-received. If you have a true compliment, give props where they\u2019re deserved. Instead of a forced compliment try asking questions, pulling out key takeaways or comparing different techniques.\r\n<h3>6. Continue Learning<\/h3>\r\nIn an ever-changing field like content creation and digital marketing you must continue to grow and stay up-to-date with the latest trends. Subscribe to and follow industry leaders and industry news publications. Set aside time for yourself to learn new skills or read up on new techniques.\r\n\r\nNot only will you impress your peers and clients with your drive and depth of knowledge, but you will also make yourself a more valuable asset.\r\n<h2 id=\"successful-habits\">7 Skills and Habits of Successful Content Creators<\/h2>\r\n<img class=\"alignnone wp-image-21149 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/07\/habits-skills-of-successful-content-creators.png\" alt=\"7 habit of successful content creators: Know the Past, Present and Future of Your Industry, Prioritize User-Intent, Look For Ideas in Usual and Unusual Places, Be Extremely Organized, Over Communicate and Then Communicate Some More, Analyze Results and Learn From Them, Behave Like Someone That You\u2019d Love to Work With\" width=\"1400\" height=\"2051\" \/>\r\n\r\nHaving a natural inclination for what makes engaging content and being creative are both important parts of becoming a great content creator\u2014but what really makes someone excel in this field is practicing good habits and putting in the hours to improve. You don\u2019t need to start out as the most amazing writer (though it is an advantage), you can and will improve your skills if you put in the effort. Below is a list of different best practices and tips that make successful content creators.\r\n<h3>1. Know Your Industry Inside Out<\/h3>\r\nSet yourself up for success by learning the ins and outs of a particular topic or field. Make it a priority to learn the past, present and future of your industry. This is especially important if you start creating content for a field you aren\u2019t as familiar with. But you should also research fields that you already feel familiar with. Read up on the basics and the past trends as well as the present state of the industry. Content should be forward-thinking, find <a href=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/seo\/kwr-emerging-trends\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">emerging keyword trends<\/a> using tools like <a href=\"https:\/\/trends.google.com\/trends\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Google Trends<\/a> and industry news to stay ahead of the curve and keep content relevant.\r\n<h3>2. Prioritize User-Intent<\/h3>\r\n<a href=\"https:\/\/moz.com\/google-algorithm-change\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Google algorithm updates<\/a> point to the importance of creating a great user experience. While a better user experience includes details like alt-text for accessibility and mobile optimizations, it also encompasses the structure and digestibility of your asset.\r\n\r\nWhen outlining or brainstorming ideas for an asset the end user should always be the priority. Think about what information they\u2019re looking for and how to best satisfy the intent behind their search through content order, design and formatting. You shouldn\u2019t need to pick between SEO and user experience, they go hand-in-hand.\r\n<h3>3. Look For Ideas in Usual and Unusual Places<\/h3>\r\nBrainstorming can be the most fun, and at times, the most challenging part of the content creation process. A common brainstorming practice is to find inspiration in related content and competitor strategies. Going with tried and true methods is a safe and effective way to drive results, but don\u2019t just rest on your laurels\u2014the best content creators are always striving to be better.\r\n\r\nA content creator that thinks outside the box is always looking for inventive ways to convey information. Whether you\u2019re creating <a href=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/creation\/content-in-boring-industries\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">content in a \u2018boring\u2019 industry<\/a> or one that\u2019s traditionally more exciting, you can find inspiration in unexpected places. Spinning the format of an asset from a completely different field is a great way to stand out and create engaging content.\r\n<h3>4. Be Extremely Organized<\/h3>\r\nGreat organization will consistently impress clients and peers and improve their confidence in your project management and your ability to hit deadlines. Try out different tactics and see what works best for you. If you have hopes of successfully managing content production or juggling many freelance jobs at once, organization is key.\r\n<h3>5. Over Communicate and Then Communicate Some More<\/h3>\r\nCommunication is vital in a successful business partnership. Make it a practice to over communicate, communicate clearly, and support recommendations with data-backed proof. Keep colleagues and clients in the loop about deadlines, performance expectations, projected ROI, and other pertinent information to set reasonable expectations from the beginning. If any of these elements are going to shift, communicate those shifts as soon as possible.\r\n<h3>6. Analyze Results and Learn From Them<\/h3>\r\nBefore engaging in any projects, there needs to be an agreement about what success would look like for a particular project or client. After a project has gone live, it\u2019s time to start tracking its actual performance against the expected results. Content success is measured by many things including <a href=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/strategy\/increase-website-traffic\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">increasing website traffic<\/a>, its conversion rate, traffic value, the number of links it generates and more.\r\n\r\nWhat good is an amazing analysis if you learn nothing from it? Great content creators pick apart what works, what doesn\u2019t, why it did or didn\u2019t work, and how to make improvements in the future. These takeaways should be communicated with your team and client, it demonstrates care and awareness.\r\n<h3>7. Behave Like Someone That You\u2019d Love to Work With<\/h3>\r\nFinally, the cardinal rule: treat others how you would like to be treated. If you\u2019re a talented creator but a drag to work with you shouldn\u2019t expect to make it far in such a collaborative industry. Reputations travel fast and stick with you longer than you think. It\u2019s crucial to put your best foot forward and represent yourself, the client\u2019s brand, and your agency with grace.\r\n\r\nBe a driving force of positivity and when you deliver criticism, do so constructively. There is little room for big egos\u2014stay humble because you never know who you might learn from next. Help create a healthy work environment, reassure colleagues when they\u2019re down and root for their successes.\r\n<h2>Ready To Create Your Own Path?<\/h2>\r\nWorking as a content creator is challenging and rewarding. You get to be a part of a rapidly growing field, create <a href=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/work\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">innovative content<\/a>, and help connect people to helpful materials.\r\n\r\nIf you\u2019re interested in learning more about Siege Media\u2019s content creation process, check out our SiegeLearn <a href=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/courses\/content-marketing\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">content marketing course<\/a> or subscribe to our <a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/c\/SiegeMedia\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">YouTube channel<\/a>.

    "title": "GPT-3 & SEO: What It Means for Content Marketing",
    "content": "If you follow AI and NLP news, you may know about the newest development from OpenAI. If you\u2019re scratching your head, read on.\r\n\r\nThis week\u2019s news of GPT-3 came bursting through the SEO industry. While natural language processing (NLP) isn\u2019t at all new, GPT-3 levels up the game. As an <a href=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/conversation\/seo-lessons\">80+ person agency<\/a> focused on content marketing, it got us wondering how this will change our industry in the coming years.\r\n\r\n<mark>Prefer to listen? Download our <a href=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/conversation\/gpt3-content-marketing\">Content &amp; Conversation podcast episode<\/a> on GPT-3 instead.<\/mark>\r\n<h2>But First, What Is GPT-3?<\/h2>\r\nGPT-3 stands for Generative Pre-training Transformer and is the third iteration from OpenAI. GPT-3 is a version of natural language processing (or NLP). NLP such as GPT-3 and others is a way to build computers that <a href=\"https:\/\/becominghuman.ai\/a-simple-introduction-to-natural-language-processing-ea66a1747b32\">read, decipher and understand human words<\/a>.\r\n\r\nNLP isn\u2019t new. In fact, versions of NLP have been around for many years now, such as Google\u2019s auto suggest in your search bar, email or Google Doc. See an example of that in action:\r\n\r\n<img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-21247\" style=\"border: 2px solid lightgrey; padding: 10px;\" src=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/07\/gpt3-typing-example.gif\" alt=\"nlp typing example\" width=\"548\" height=\"206\" \/>\r\n\r\nAs you can see above, Gmail autofills portions of my email based on commonly used words and phrases. Keep in mind that GPT-3 is not associated with Gmail or Google, but the basic idea remains the same.\r\n<h2>Why Is GPT-3 a Big Deal?<\/h2>\r\nWhat makes GPT-3 a bigger deal than other previous versions of of GPT (and other NLP tools from other companies summarized below:\r\n<h3>Total Parameters<\/h3>\r\nParameters means the amount of data GPT-3 has to base its predictions off of. The previous iteration of this (GPT-2) worked off of 1.5 billion parameters. This version has 175 billion. Overall, this makes it a much more powerful tool because of the larger dataset it has to work off of.\r\n<h3>Task Agnostic<\/h3>\r\nAs mentioned <a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=lQnLwUfwgyA\">here<\/a>, GPT-3 is task agnostic. Meaning you can create content for any need or platform necessary. As shown in my email example above, that NLP system only functions within Gmail and Google docs. You can\u2019t open it up in a Microsoft Word document or Facebook post and expect the same thing to happen. OpenAI\u2019s GPT-3, though, allows you to apply this content to anywhere.\r\n<h3>Minimal Tuning<\/h3>\r\nAnother big selling point is how good the final copy actually is. This goes back to the large parameters the tool is referencing. Once given an outline to follow, GPT-3 can produce a pretty solid first draft. In some studies, GPT-3 fooled up to 88% of people when they had to guess if the copy was written by a bot or a human.\r\n\r\nIf you want a more in-depth descriptions of the points above, I recommend watching this video by Aaron Jack:\r\n\r\n<iframe src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/lQnLwUfwgyA\" width=\"700\" height=\"393\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"><\/iframe>\r\n<h2>Is GPT-3 Free?<\/h2>\r\nCurrently, no, and there is a good reason for that. In previous open source models there was concern about what would happen to the web if tools like this were accessible to people looking to do harm. You can read more from OpenAI about how they\u2019re thinking about things like harmful bias and low quality content in <a href=\"https:\/\/openai.com\/blog\/openai-api\/\">their FAQ<\/a> and the rationale behind a commercial release. For now, OpenAI API is remaining in beta and you can sign up via <a href=\"https:\/\/forms.office.com\/Pages\/ResponsePage.aspx?id=VsqMpNrmTkioFJyEllK8s0v5E5gdyQhOuZCXNuMR8i1UQjFWVTVUVEpGNkg3U1FNRDVVRFg3U0w4Vi4u\">this waitlist<\/a>.\r\n<h2>What Does This Mean for SEO?<\/h2>\r\nNow that you have a high level overview of GPT-3, time to answer what you really came here for. So, are we all out of a job?\r\n\r\nThe short answer for us is: no. But the longer answer is: you may want to reconsider what your core skill or service offering is.\r\n\r\nFor us, our content marketing service extends far beyond just writing blog copy. Our <a href=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/strategy\/train-content-marketer\">content marketing specialists receive training<\/a> on SEO best practices, design and UX and outreach in addition to writing. In fact, writing is only 50% or less of a specialist\u2019s role at Siege. We focus on building a set of many skills in order to provide our clients more value than just a blog post.\r\n\r\nIf 60% or more of your deliverables (either in house or as a freelancer or agency) is writing content, it may be worth expanding your skill set to be a more diverse marketer.\r\n\r\nWith that, the news of GPT-3 has us strategically thinking of the following:\r\n<h3>Create short form content at scale<\/h3>\r\nGPT-3 will really excel for any writing project where you have to write a series of \u201clow\u201d value content at high volume. While no one likes to think about any content of their site being considered \u201clow value,\u201d <a href=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/marketing\/google-search-operators\">search engines<\/a> have made it necessary to include copy on pages that most users will ignore.\r\n\r\nExamples of this include:\r\n<ul>\r\n \t<li>Footer copy on product and product category pages<\/li>\r\n \t<li>Meta descriptions for old content<\/li>\r\n \t<li>Alt text and similar missing SEO elements<\/li>\r\n \t<li>Unique product copy for companies with 10,000+ products<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n<h3>Draft evergreen, long form content<\/h3>\r\nOutside of short form, GPT-3 also excels at longer form content (which is another unique feature). If there are topics in your industry that are evergreen and written about consistently (e.g. definition queries, standard processes, etc.) GPT-3 can work off a short outline and provide a working first draft. I say \u201cfirst draft\u201d because...\r\n<h3>Writers become editors<\/h3>\r\nThe more sophisticated a tool like GPT-3 becomes, the less of a need there will be for pure \u201cwriters.\u201d If tools like this can produce any type of content in a much faster timeline (think: seconds) than a copywriter, then the role of the copywriter will likely change.\r\n\r\nTo us, we see our industry shifting to more of an editor model where a tool like GPT-3 will get you a good working first draft while you focus on leveling up the content to fit your brand.\r\nIf I Use GPT-3, What Should I Be Careful Of?\r\n\r\nGPT-3 isn\u2019t a \u201cset it and forget it\u201d solution. Two big areas of concern when using this (and similar NLP tools):\r\n<h3>Beware of content \u201csameness\u201d<\/h3>\r\nInternally, we follow <a href=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/creation\/blog-post-templates\">common blog templates<\/a> and formats in order to scale our production. We also use tools like Ahrefs Keyword Explorer and Clearvoice to help us incorporate appropriate keywords and keyword frequency. But relying solely on existing templates and tools creates a model where it\u2019s easy to mirror what\u2019s already out there (or make it easier for your competitors to copy your model).\r\n\r\nFor example, check out these two posts by <a href=\"https:\/\/www.shopify.com\/retail\/what-is-a-sku-number\">Shopify<\/a> and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.thebalancesmb.com\/what-is-a-sku-in-retail-terms-2890158\">The Balance<\/a> both ranking for \u201c<a href=\"https:\/\/www.google.com\/search?rlz=1C5CHFA_enUS697US697&amp;ei=AF0XX_VR_sfQ8Q_vprnQAg&amp;q=what+is+a+sku&amp;oq=what+is+a+sku&amp;gs_lcp=CgZwc3ktYWIQAzICCAAyAggAMgIIADICCAAyAggAMgIIADICCAAyAggAMgIIADICCAA6BAgAEEc6BAgAEEM6BQgAEJECOgUIABCxAzoICAAQsQMQgwE6BwgAELEDEEM6CggAEJECEEYQ-QFQ5YwCWIORAmCZngJoAHABeACAAXaIAZoEkgEDMS40mAEAoAEBqgEHZ3dzLXdpesABAQ&amp;sclient=psy-ab&amp;ved=0ahUKEwj10cX2o9_qAhX-IzQIHW9TDioQ4dUDCAw&amp;uact=5\">what is a SKU<\/a>\u201d:\r\n\r\n<img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-21254\" src=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/07\/gpt3-seo-sku_1.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"700\" height=\"650\" \/>\r\n\r\nAt a quick glance, the headline, subheads and core points are almost identical. It\u2019s likely the team behind both of these articles researched the appropriate keywords to use and the type of content Google is serving for this query in order to match their post against those expectations.\r\n\r\nSo while we still use these tools, our work doesn\u2019t stop here. The real work goes into leveling up that content to make it unique to the industry. Some of my favorite examples of this include:\r\n<ul>\r\n \t<li>Including unique customer data when answering a \u201cwhat is\u201d query like CleverTap\u2019s <a href=\"https:\/\/clevertap.com\/blog\/what-are-push-notifications\/\">\u201cWhat are push notifications?\u201d post<\/a><\/li>\r\n \t<li>Case studies with quotes from experts like Valpak\u2019s <a href=\"https:\/\/www.valpak.com\/advertise\/blog\/social-media-small-business\">social media guide<\/a><\/li>\r\n \t<li>Unique UX like Nextiva\u2019s <a href=\"https:\/\/www.nextiva.com\/blog\/customer-service-statistics.html\">customer service statistics<\/a><\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\nAll of the above produce a much richer experience for the end user and content that is unique to the SERP.\r\n<h3>Biased, racist and sexist language<\/h3>\r\nIt\u2019s hard news to swallow, but if NLP is basing its output from what\u2019s inputted\u2014and that language is already biased\u2014then the end result will be the same. Max Woolf addresses this shortcoming in <a href=\"https:\/\/minimaxir.com\/2020\/07\/gpt3-expectations\/\">his post reviewing GPT-3<\/a>.\r\n\r\nYou may be thinking \u201cmy industry isn\u2019t biased so I have nothing to worry about,\u201d but if you\u2019re focused on <a href=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/seo\/ymyl\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">YMYL topics<\/a> such as finance, medicine and health &amp; wellness, these tools aren\u2019t meant for sensitivity. In these areas, it\u2019s even more important to carefully edit the output you\u2019re receiving.\r\n<h2>Are the Bots Out for Your Job?<\/h2>\r\nGPT-3 is an interesting development for content writers and SEOs. While how quickly this will change the industry is unknown, it\u2019s obvious NLP is only going to grow in importance as the technology becomes more advanced.\r\n\r\nIf you want to read more about NLP in general, some of my favorite go to\u2019s include:\r\n<ul>\r\n \t<li><a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/britneymuller?lang=en\">Britney Muller<\/a> and <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/Kevin_Indig\">Kevin Indig\u2019s<\/a> NLP discussion on <a href=\"https:\/\/www.kevin-indig.com\/learning-machine-learning-for-seo-w-britney-muller\/\">Tech Bound<\/a><\/li>\r\n \t<li>Ruth Burr Reedy\u2019s <a href=\"https:\/\/moz.com\/blog\/better-content-through-natural-language-processing\">Moz Whiteboard Friday<\/a> on NLP and content<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>"

    "content": "You\u2019ve carved away time in your day to write a blog post. An hour passes and all you have to show is a few jumbled sentences.\r\n\r\nYou convince yourself you just need an example or something to model your post after. That\u2019s all! You click over to [insert name of any high DA, beautifully designed website that ranks for everything] for some inspiration and notice that in the past hour they\u2019ve posted seven original blog posts. All in a different format. How do they make it seem so easy?\r\n\r\nBlog writing is a skill that takes time and practice. Whether you\u2019re a digital marketer working with an established brand or an entrepreneur trying to create an online presence, a <a href=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/creation\/what-makes-good-blog-post\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">well-crafted blog post<\/a> can increase your visibility.\r\n\r\nTo help you save hours of aimless writing, we\u2019ve created eight blog post templates to guide your content. While some of these are created with SEO optimization in mind, other templates are geared toward building your voice as a thought leader.\r\n\r\nRegardless of your goal, these post structures have been proven to drive results. Our 110-person content marketing agency has helped over 10 clients generate <a href=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/work\">250,000+ visitors per month<\/a>.\r\n\r\nRead through to find how to choose the right <a href=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/creation\/types-of-content-marketing\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">type of post<\/a> for your topic and how to properly structure it so you can generate similar results.\r\n\r\n<img class=\"alignnone wp-image-21214 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/07\/choosing-your-post-structure.png\" alt=\"graphic that explains how to choose the structure of a post\" width=\"1401\" height=\"675\" \/>\r\n<h2>How to Choose the Right Post Type<\/h2>\r\nSome topics have a clear post-type while others can be more of a gray area.\r\n\r\nOnce you\u2019ve landed on a topic idea, you\u2019ll want to look to Google to see what types of posts are ranking. Not only will this give you an idea of what\u2019s needed to rank, but you\u2019ll get a better understanding of user intent.\r\n\r\nThe search intent for some keywords are more obvious than others. For example, someone searching for \u201cchocolate cake\u201d is most likely looking for a step-by-step guide with a recipe. Looking at the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.google.com\/search?q=chocolate+cake&amp;oq=chocolate+cake&amp;aqs=chrome..69i57j46j0l4j69i60l2.2973j0j7&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">chocolate cake SERP<\/a> confirms this.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, a keyword like \u201ccharcuterie board\u201d is more vague. Are people searching for a board to buy or a tutorial on how to make one? If you can spell charcuterie correctly, the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.google.com\/search?q=charcuterie+board&amp;oq=charcuterie+board&amp;aqs=chrome.0.69i59j0l6j69i60.283j0j7&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">SERP<\/a> will primarily show guides on how to make these boards. Based on this you\u2019ll want to structure your content as a how-to post.\r\n\r\nOnce you determine the types of posts that are ranking for your topic, you can mirror the structure with one of these blog post templates.\r\n<h3>Make Your Content Unique<\/h3>\r\nSuccessful content isn\u2019t templated. While these post templates can help you emulate the post structure that Google is valuing, you\u2019ll also need to add your own creative elements to <a href=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/marketing\/creative-content\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">make the content unique<\/a>. What you add between the H2s will differentiate you from your competitors and lead to more sustainable rankings.\r\n\r\nThere are endless ways you can add value to your content. Write about the topic from a new angle. Incorporate quotes from experts on the topic. Include unique custom photography. Add GIFs instead of photos. Provide printables that readers can use. And the list goes on. Differentiating your content with these value-adds will help you stand out from the sea of sameness.\r\n\r\nJump to:\r\n<ul>\r\n \t<li><a href=\"#how-to-post\">How-To Post Template<\/a><\/li>\r\n \t<li><a href=\"#list-post\">List Post Template<\/a><\/li>\r\n \t<li><a href=\"#what-is-post\">\u201cWhat is\u201d Post Template<\/a><\/li>\r\n \t<li><a href=\"#case-study-post\">Case Study Post Template<\/a><\/li>\r\n \t<li><a href=\"#survey-post\">Survey Post Template<\/a><\/li>\r\n \t<li><a href=\"#x-vs-y-post\">X vs. Y Post Template<\/a><\/li>\r\n \t<li><a href=\"#beginners-guide-post\">Beginner\u2019s Guide Post Template<\/a><\/li>\r\n \t<li><a href=\"#infographic-post\">Infographic Post Template<\/a><\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n<a name=\"how-to-post\"><\/a>\r\n<h2>1. How-To Post Template<\/h2>\r\nAs the name implies, a how-to post teaches you how to do something. This guide is typically broken down into simple steps that are easy to follow. The reader should be able to mimic the process themselves, without any outstanding questions.\r\n\r\nThis usually requires a combination of descriptions and photos. Using other visual elements such as <a href=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/creation\/animated-infographics\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">animation<\/a> or <a href=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/services\/san-diego-video-production\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">video<\/a> can take your how-to post to the next level as well.\r\n<h3>How-To Post Examples<\/h3>\r\nA how-to post can be brainstormed for any industry. When deciding on a topic, consider what your audience would find beneficial. Does a product you offer need additional instruction on how to use? Is there a unique way to incorporate or showcase your product in daily life?\r\n\r\nHere are some blog post examples of how-to posts in different industries:\r\n<ul>\r\n \t<li>Floral: <a href=\"https:\/\/www.ftd.com\/blog\/design\/how-to-arrange-flowers\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">How to Arrange Flowers<\/a><\/li>\r\n \t<li>Cybersecurity: <a href=\"https:\/\/www.pandasecurity.com\/mediacenter\/malware\/chromium-virus\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">How to Remove Chromium Virus<\/a><\/li>\r\n \t<li>Construction: <a href=\"https:\/\/www.bigrentz.com\/blog\/how-to-start-construction-company\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">How to Start a Construction Company<\/a><\/li>\r\n \t<li>Finance: <a href=\"https:\/\/blog.mint.com\/how-to\/st-patricks-day-breakfast\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">How to Host a St. Patrick\u2019s Day Breakfast Without Breaking the Bank<\/a><\/li>\r\n \t<li>Travel: <a href=\"https:\/\/www.carrentals.com\/blog\/how-to-make-a-push-pin-travel-map\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">How to Make a Push Pin Travel Map<\/a><\/li>\r\n \t<li>Food: <a href=\"https:\/\/www.berries.com\/blog\/donut-wall-diy\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Donut Wall DIY and Styling Tips<\/a><\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n<h3>What to Include in a How-To Post<\/h3>\r\nHow-to posts are structured with a title, introduction, materials needed, steps with photos and a conclusion.\r\n\r\n<img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-20736 size-large\" src=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/06\/how-to-post-template-405x1024.png\" alt=\"graphic that shows a how to post template outline\" width=\"405\" height=\"1024\" \/>\r\n<h4>Title<\/h4>\r\nThe title of a how-to post will be structured \u201cHow to X.\u201d The exact phrasing will depend on if you\u2019re going after a keyword. If so, be sure to include the exact keyword naturally towards the beginning of the title.\r\n<h4>Introduction<\/h4>\r\nIn the introduction, you\u2019ll give a brief overview of the topic.\r\n\r\nIf the topic is straightforward like \u201cHow to Arrange Flowers,\u201d you won\u2019t need as much of an introduction. The person searching will want to get straight to the step-by-step guide and a long introduction could cause them to lose interest and bounce.\r\n\r\nFor topics that have more depth to them, such as \u201cHow to Remove Chromium Virus,\u201d you may need a longer introduction. In this case, you\u2019d want to take the time to explain what Chromium is and how to tell if you have the virus on your device.\r\n\r\nIn this intro, give an overview of what you\u2019ll be teaching in the post. Be as specific as possible so readers know what to expect.\r\n<h4>Materials<\/h4>\r\nThis will be a list of the supplies you\u2019ll need to complete the tutorial. These materials should be formatted as bullet points so they are scannable. If you don\u2019t need any supplies to complete the how-to, you can skip this section.\r\n<h4>Steps<\/h4>\r\nNext, you\u2019ll create a numbered list of the steps. Each step should be formatted as a header and start with a verb so that it\u2019s clear what action the reader should take.\r\n<ul>\r\n \t<li><strong>What not to do:<\/strong> Step Three: Plant Food Should Go into the Vase<\/li>\r\n \t<li><strong>Correct version:<\/strong> 3. Pour Plant Food into the Vase<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\nAfter the numbered step, add a paragraph of explanation. Elaborate on what should be done. What issues might the reader run into? What should they avoid during this step?\r\n<h4>Photos<\/h4>\r\nA photo will usually accompany each step. This helps demonstrate how you\u2019re supposed to complete the action. You\u2019re most likely speaking to a broad audience, with many different levels of familiarity on the topic. The more assets you can provide to help guide them, the better.\r\n<h4>Conclusion<\/h4>\r\nBy the end of the steps, the reader should have finished what they set out to do. The conclusion is an opportunity to remind the audience of the new skills they have, thanks to your guide.\r\n\r\nConclude with a call to action. This could be a link to your product or a push to check out other guides on your blog.\r\n<h4>How-to Schema<\/h4>\r\nThe how-to rich snippet on Google helps searchers easily find step-by-step information. To structure your information in a way that Google can use for this feature, be sure to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.searchenginewatch.com\/2019\/05\/30\/implement-googles-how-to-schema\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">add how-to schema markup<\/a> to your post.\r\n\r\nDownload the free blog post template for a how-to post here:\r\n\r\n<a href=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/06\/How-To-Post-Template.docx\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-20733 size-medium\" src=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/06\/download-word-doc-button-400x74.png\" alt=\"button that says download word doc\" width=\"400\" height=\"74\" \/><\/a>\r\n<a href=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/06\/How-To-Post-Template.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-20732 size-medium\" src=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/06\/download-pdf-button-400x74.png\" alt=\"button that says download pdf\" width=\"400\" height=\"74\" \/><\/a>\r\n<a name=\"list-post\"><\/a>\r\n<h2>2. List Post Template<\/h2>\r\nAnother common post type is the list post, also known as a listicle. The intention of this post is to share a <a href=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/creation\/content-curation\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">curated roundup<\/a> of inspiration that\u2019s easily digestible for the reader. Rather than doing their own research on the topic, readers can find all the examples conveniently in one place.\r\n<h3>List Post Examples<\/h3>\r\nList posts are a great way to showcase product-related inspiration. Typically, a brand\u2019s offering will be featured on the list or suggested in the CTA at the end.\r\n\r\nHere are some examples of list posts in different industries:\r\n<ul>\r\n \t<li>Wedding: <a href=\"https:\/\/www.zola.com\/expert-advice\/wedding-cake-ideas\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">112 Wedding Cake Ideas &amp; Design<\/a><\/li>\r\n \t<li>Home:\u00a0 <a href=\"https:\/\/kitchencabinetkings.com\/infographics\/clean-pots-pans\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">23 Hacks for Cleaning Your Pots and Pans<\/a><\/li>\r\n \t<li>Floral: <a href=\"https:\/\/www.proflowers.com\/blog\/plant-and-cactus-puns\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">50 Plant and Cactus Puns for Your Inner Plant Lady<\/a><\/li>\r\n \t<li>Business: <a href=\"https:\/\/clevertap.com\/blog\/value-proposition-examples\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">21 Value Proposition Examples and Takeaways From Billion Dollar Companies<\/a><\/li>\r\n \t<li>Cybersecurity: <a href=\"https:\/\/www.varonis.com\/blog\/cybersecurity-tips\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">52 Key Cybersecurity Tips: Your Playbook for Unrivaled Security<\/a><\/li>\r\n \t<li>Holiday: <a href=\"https:\/\/www.shutterfly.com\/ideas\/christmas-photo\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">50 Festive Christmas Photo Ideas<\/a><\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n<h3>What to Include in a List Post<\/h3>\r\nList posts should include a title, introduction, numbered or bulleted list with photos and conclusion.\r\n\r\n<img class=\"wp-image-20738 size-large aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/06\/list-post-templates-413x1024.png\" alt=\"Graphic of a list blog post template\" width=\"413\" height=\"1024\" \/>\r\n<h4>Title<\/h4>\r\nThe title will usually be formatted with the number first and then the topic.\r\n\r\nSome common list title formats are:\r\n<ul>\r\n \t<li>X ADJECTIVE TOPIC<\/li>\r\n \t<li>X TOPIC Hacks<\/li>\r\n \t<li>X TOPIC Ideas<\/li>\r\n \t<li>X Types of TOPIC<\/li>\r\n \t<li>X Ways to TOPIC<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\nWhen choosing how many to include in your list, you\u2019ll want to reference the SERP. If all the ranking posts have 50+ ideas and you only have 5, your post won\u2019t get clicked on or have much of a chance ranking. On the other hand, more isn\u2019t always better. Usually, people would rather look through 20 quality options rather than sifting through 200 mediocre ones. Be strategic when considering how many items to include.\r\n<h4>Introduction<\/h4>\r\nThe introduction for list posts is usually pretty straightforward. Begin with a hook and then introduce the topic. If you organized your list into categories, explain this in the introduction.\r\n\r\nBe sure to include a sentence that gives an overview exactly what you\u2019ll be listing.\r\n\r\nExample overview sentences:\r\n<ul>\r\n \t<li>\u201cExplore 50 fresh ways to make your family photo ideas shine this Christmas season.\u201d<\/li>\r\n \t<li>\u201cHere is a list of 21 value propositions from companies who have reached a valuation of $1 billion or more.\u201d<\/li>\r\n \t<li>\u201cThe cybersecurity tips below cover awareness, basic safety, online safety, social media, data security, tips for remote workers, small businesses and considerations for CEOs and CISOs to keep in mind.\u201d<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n<h4>List<\/h4>\r\nNext, you\u2019ll create your list. The list should be numbered or bulleted so that it can easily be scanned. If the list is longer than about 20, consider sectioning the items into groups or themes.\r\n\r\nTry utilizing longtail keywords as H2s to divide your list. For example, this <a href=\"https:\/\/www.zola.com\/expert-advice\/wedding-cake-ideas\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">wedding cake ideas list<\/a> is organized by season with longtail keywords like \u201cwedding cake ideas for summer\u201d and \u201cwedding cake ideas for spring.\u201d\r\n<h4>Photos<\/h4>\r\nIf your list is shorter than 10, try to include a photo for every listed item. For longer lists, you can add a photo or graphic every 4-5 paragraphs to break up the copy.\r\n\r\nReference ranking posts in the SERP to see how many photos you\u2019ll need to include. Depending on the topic, some posts will require a photo for every listed item, no matter the length.\r\n<h4>Conclusion<\/h4>\r\nConclude the post with a call to action. How can the reader use this information in combination with your product offering? This is a good place to include an internal link.\r\n\r\nDownload the free blog post template for a list post here:\r\n\r\n<a href=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/06\/List-Post-Template.docx\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-20733 size-medium\" src=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/06\/download-word-doc-button-400x74.png\" alt=\"button that says download word doc\" width=\"400\" height=\"74\" \/><\/a>\r\n\r\n<a href=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/06\/List-Post-Template.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-20732 size-medium\" src=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/06\/download-pdf-button-400x74.png\" alt=\"button that says download pdf\" width=\"400\" height=\"74\" \/><\/a>\r\n<a name=\"what-is-post\"><\/a>\r\n<h2>3. \u201cWhat Is\u201d Post Template<\/h2>\r\nA \u201cwhat is\u201d post is an informational post that answers a question. This type of post should be chosen carefully. While it can be a good way to build brand awareness and become an authority on a topic, this type of keyword has one of the <a href=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/seo\/keywords-worst-ctr\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">worst click through rates<\/a>.\r\n\r\nReaders don\u2019t usually spend much time on \u201cwhat is\u201d posts because they are looking for a simple answer. When Googling this type of question, the user will usually find their solution in a quick answer box or the first result. Oftentimes, they don\u2019t even need to click into the first ranking post because they receive an immediate answer.\r\n<h3>\u201cWhat Is\u201d Post Examples<\/h3>\r\nIf you do decide to take on a \u201cwhat is\u201d post, try to pick a question that is more complex. If it needs more than a sentence to explain, you can build out your post around the question.\r\n\r\nThis will also give you the opportunity to rank for the base keyword (which usually has more search volume). For example, while going after the keyword \u201cwhat is captcha\u201d that has a search volume of 3,400 monthly searches you could also rank for \u201ccaptcha\u201d which has 46,000 monthly searches.\r\n\r\nExamples of \u201cwhat is\u201d posts in different industries:\r\n<ul>\r\n \t<li>Cybersecurity: <a href=\"https:\/\/www.pandasecurity.com\/mediacenter\/panda-security\/what-is-captcha\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">What is Captcha?<\/a><\/li>\r\n \t<li>Finance: <a href=\"https:\/\/blog.mint.com\/early-career\/social-currency\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Social Currency: What Is It and How to Use it to Build Your Personal Brand<\/a><\/li>\r\n \t<li>Insurance: <a href=\"https:\/\/www.thezebra.com\/resources\/driving\/what-is-a-smart-city\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">What is a Smart City?<\/a><\/li>\r\n \t<li>Business: <a href=\"https:\/\/clevertap.com\/blog\/what-is-a-control-group\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">What is Control Group and Why is it Important in Testing?<\/a><\/li>\r\n \t<li>Home decor: <a href=\"https:\/\/www.invaluable.com\/blog\/what-is-feng-shui\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">What is Feng Shui?

You should be able to do this in 1-2 short paragraphs.\r\n<h4>Paragraph That Answers the Question<\/h4>\r\nEither in the introduction or after the first H2, you\u2019ll want to directly answer the question. Do this as concisely as possible so you have a better chance to rank in the quick answer box. This will also provide the most value for the reader. If the information is provided in a clear structure, they will easily be able to scan and understand the content.\r\n<h4>Explanatory Paragraphs<\/h4>\r\nThe following headers and paragraphs should elaborate on the topic. This is a good place to incorporate related questions or examples.\r\n\r\nWhen writing these following paragraphs, consider the other W\u2019s: Who, Where, When and Why.\r\n\r\nSome questions to consider:\r\n<ul>\r\n \t<li>Who benefits from X?<\/li>\r\n \t<li>When should you use\/implement X?<\/li>\r\n \t<li>Where should X be used?<\/li>\r\n \t<li>Why is X the best option?<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n<h4>Conclusion<\/h4>\r\nWhen you\u2019ve fully explained the topic, you\u2019ll want to conclude with a summary of the post. What did the reader learn and how can they apply it to their life? Include a CTA that has a link to your product or offering.\r\n\r\nDownload the free blog post template for a \u201cwhat is\u201d post here:\r\n\r\n<a href=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/06\/What-is-Post-Template.docx\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-20733 size-medium\" src=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/06\/download-word-doc-button-400x74.png\" alt=\"button that says download word doc\" width=\"400\" height=\"74\" \/><\/a>\r\n\r\n<a href=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/06\/What-is-Post-Template.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-20732 size-medium\" src=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/06\/download-pdf-button-400x74.png\" alt=\"button that says download pdf\" width=\"400\" height=\"74\" \/><\/a>\r\n<a name=\"case-study-post\"><\/a>\r\n<h2>4. Case Study Post Template<\/h2>\r\nA case study is a deep dive into a specific topic. This type of post should be backed up with data and include a comprehensive analysis.\r\n\r\nWhen done correctly, a case study is highly linkable. If you can make clear and surprising claims based on the case study, the data can be picked up by news sites or repurposed by other bloggers.\r\n<h3>Case Study Post Examples<\/h3>\r\nBy <a href=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/creation\/importxml-google-sheets\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">leveraging data in your industry<\/a>, you can create a case study post. These take some time to build out, but they can gain passive links for months to come.\r\n\r\nHere are a few blog post examples of case studies in different industries:\r\n<ul>\r\n \t<li>Business: <a href=\"https:\/\/clevertap.com\/blog\/emoji-marketing\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Emoji Marketing Data Study With Push Notification Trends<\/a><\/li>\r\n \t<li>Cybersecurity: <a href=\"https:\/\/www.varonis.com\/blog\/data-risk-report-highlights-2019\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">2019 Data Risk Report Stats and Tips You Won\u2019t Want to Miss<\/a><\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n<h3>What to Include in Case Study Post<\/h3>\r\nA case study post has a broad overview of the topic, an introduction of the study, an analysis of the data and a conclusion.\r\n\r\n<img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-20735 size-large\" src=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/06\/case-study-post-template-385x1024.png\" alt=\"Graphic of case study blog post template outline\" width=\"385\" height=\"1024\" \/>\r\n<h4>Title<\/h4>\r\nWhen writing a case study title you should summarize what the study is about. When doing this, consider what the reader will be able to take away from the post and why it\u2019s worth their time.\r\n<h4>Broad Overview of the Topic<\/h4>\r\nThe introduction will explain what the topic is. If it\u2019s complex, spend a few paragraphs elaborating on any details you think the reader should know before continuing to the data.\r\n<h4>Introduce the Study<\/h4>\r\nNext, you\u2019ll introduce the study. What data did you look at? What tools did you use? How did you organize it? Who were the key players involved? What problem were you trying to solve?\r\n\r\nThis is where you\u2019ll be building your credibility. If there are any gray areas or the reader is confused by the process, the rest of the post won\u2019t be believable. Be sure to spend time detailing your process. Have someone else who\u2019s not involved with the study read it to ensure it makes sense to a fresh pair of eyes.\r\n<h4>Analyze the Data<\/h4>\r\nThe next paragraphs will transition to the analysis section of the case study. What did the data show? Include the raw data and elaborate on what story it tells. Be sure to add photos or graphics to depict the results in a clear way.\r\n<h4>Conclusion<\/h4>\r\nConclude with your main takeaways and a call to action. How can the reader use this information in their daily life? Should they alter their habits based on your results?\r\n\r\nDownload the free blog post template for a case study post here:\r\n\r\n<a href=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/06\/Case-Study-Post-Template.docx\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-20733 size-medium\" src=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/06\/download-word-doc-button-400x74.png\" alt=\"button that says download word doc\" width=\"400\" height=\"74\" \/><\/a>\r\n\r\n<a href=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/06\/Case-Study-Post-Template.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-20732 size-medium\" src=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/06\/download-pdf-button-400x74.png\" alt=\"button that says download pdf\" width=\"400\" height=\"74\" \/><\/a>\r\n<a name=\"survey-post\"><\/a>\r\n<h2>5. Survey Post Template<\/h2>\r\nA survey post is similar to a case study, but the data isn\u2019t as comprehensive. This type of post is based on polling the public through a survey platform like <a href=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/creation\/google-consumer-surveys-for-content-marketers\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Google Consumer Surveys<\/a>. The data from your survey can then be used to create a post.\r\n<h3>Survey Post Examples<\/h3>\r\nSurvey posts usually provide clickable titles with surprising statistics. The surveys that are the most shareable are the ones that have an emotional tie. Readers can relate to the topic and want to pass it on to others who might find it relatable as well.\r\n\r\nTo give you an idea of what a survey post looks like, here are a variety of examples:\r\n<ul>\r\n \t<li>Travel: <a href=\"https:\/\/www.carrentals.com\/blog\/driving-with-germs-study\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">One-Third of Drivers Only Clean Their Can Once a Year<\/a><\/li>\r\n \t<li>Insurance: <a href=\"https:\/\/www.thezebra.com\/resources\/home\/neighbors-survey\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">66% of Americans Aren\u2019t Friends with their Neighbors<\/a><\/li>\r\n \t<li>Construction: <a href=\"https:\/\/www.bigrentz.com\/blog\/survey-can-americans-recognize-cities-without-their-skyscrapers\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Survey: Can Americans Recognize Cities without Their Skyscrapers?<\/a><\/li>\r\n \t<li>Finance: <a href=\"https:\/\/blog.mint.com\/budgeting\/holiday-gift-survey\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Survey: Would you Prefer Cash Over Presents for the Holidays?<\/a><\/li>\r\n \t<li>Retail: <a href=\"https:\/\/tommyjohn.com\/blogs\/news\/underwear-hygiene-study\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">America\u2019s Dirty Laundry: 45% of Americans Wear Underwear for Two Days or Longer<\/a><\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\nWhich one made you click to learn more?\r\n<h3>What to Include in Survey Posts<\/h3>\r\nA survey post typically has an introduction to the topic, the findings, graphics to better explain the data, a call to action and the methodology.\r\n\r\n<img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-20739 size-large\" src=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/06\/survey-post-template-415x1024.png\" alt=\"graphic of a survey blog post template outline\" width=\"415\" height=\"1024\" \/>\r\n<h4>Title<\/h4>\r\nThe title of a survey post is the hook. In most cases, the title should proclaim your most intriguing stat. You can see above that the examples show a variety of stats in the titles.\r\n\r\nIn some cases, it will be more interesting to title your article based on the survey question you asked. If this is the case, readers will click on the title to see if their answer is the correct one. For example, in a post on if you prefer cash over presents during the holidays, the reader would click on your article to see if their answer is the same as the people surveyed.\r\n<h4>Introduction<\/h4>\r\nThis will provide a little insight into the topic and explain what led you to ask these questions. Why should people care about the topic?\r\n\r\nThe introduction can also include an overview of key findings. If you decide to include this, create 3-5 bullets of the most interesting and surprising data. Putting these stats at the top of the post makes it easy for new sites or researchers to pull your findings and quote them.\r\n<h4>The Findings<\/h4>\r\nIn the following paragraphs, you\u2019ll go in-depth on your survey results. Try elaborating on the initial findings by organizing results by age, location, race or gender.\r\n<h4>Graphics<\/h4>\r\nTo make your data more digestible and shareable, turn the most interesting findings into graphics. These will be helpful for those who just want an overview of the topic and don\u2019t want to read in-depth about your discovery.\r\n<h4>Conclusion<\/h4>\r\nOnce the findings are highlighted and explained, make a call to action. What can the reader do with this information? Should they change their actions based on your survey? What lessons can be derived from these statistics?\r\n<h4>Methodology<\/h4>\r\nLast but not least is the methodology section. This should sum up how and when your survey was conducted.\r\n\r\nSome questions to answer in the methodology section:\r\n<ul>\r\n \t<li>What platform was the data collected on?<\/li>\r\n \t<li>How many people were surveyed?<\/li>\r\n \t<li>Who was surveyed?<\/li>\r\n \t<li>When was the data collected?<\/li>\r\n \t<li>Was post-stratification weighting used?<\/li>\r\n \t<li>Was there a margin of error?<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\nDownload the free blog post template for a survey post here:\r\n\r\n<a href=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/06\/Survey-Post-Template.docx\"><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-20733 size-medium\" src=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/06\/download-word-doc-button-400x74.png\" alt=\"button that says download word doc\" width=\"400\" height=\"74\" \/><\/a>\r\n\r\n<a href=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/06\/Survey-Post-Template.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-20732 size-medium\" src=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/06\/download-pdf-button-400x74.png\" alt=\"button that says download pdf\" width=\"400\" height=\"74\" \/><\/a>\r\n<a name=\"x-vs-y-post\"><\/a>\r\n<h2>6. X vs. Y Post Template<\/h2>\r\nAn X vs. Y post is an article that compares two items. Usually, the reader is trying to choose which item is best for their situation, so they want to see a side-by-side comparison to help them decide.\r\n\r\nThese comparison posts are a great way to highlight why your product or offering might be better than the competition. People searching this type of term are likely in the interest or even consideration phase of the marketing funnel, so the right argument could sway them to purchase your offering.\r\n<h3>X vs. Y Post Examples<\/h3>\r\nThe X vs. Y posts are formatted with a similar structure. They specify two topics, describe each, then compare them side-by-side.\r\n\r\nTo give you an idea of X vs. Y posts, here are some examples from different industries:\r\n<ul>\r\n \t<li>Beauty: <a href=\"https:\/\/www.fragrancex.com\/blog\/fragrance-oils-vs-essential-oils\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Fragrance Oils vs. Essential Oils<\/a><\/li>\r\n \t<li>Food: <a href=\"https:\/\/www.invaluable.com\/blog\/bourbon-vs-whiskey\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Bourbon vs. Whiskey: Understanding the Difference Between Dark Sprits<\/a><\/li>\r\n \t<li>Cybersecurity: <a href=\"https:\/\/www.pandasecurity.com\/mediacenter\/privacy\/tor-vs-vpn\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Tor vs. VPN: What They Do and Which is Better<\/a><\/li>\r\n \t<li>Technology: <a href=\"https:\/\/clevertap.com\/blog\/mms-vs-sms\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">MMS vs SMS: How Are These Messaging Services Different?<\/a><\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n<h3>What to Include in an X vs. Y Post<\/h3>\r\nAn X vs. Y post will have an introduction, explanation of what X is, pros and cons of X, what Y is, pros and cons of Y, a side-by-side comparison and a conclusion on which you should choose.\r\n\r\n<img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-20741 size-large\" src=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/06\/x-vs-y-post-template-358x1024.png\" alt=\"graphic of x vs y blog post template outline\" width=\"358\" height=\"1024\" \/>\r\n<h4>Title<\/h4>\r\nThe title of this post will be \u201cX vs. Y.\u201d If the terms are abbreviations or don\u2019t make sense on their own, add explanatory copy for context. For example, the title \u201c<a href=\"https:\/\/www.pandasecurity.com\/mediacenter\/security\/wpa-vs-wpa2\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">WPA vs WPA2: Which WiFi Security Should You Use?<\/a>\u201d clarifies that the post will be discussing wifi security.\r\n<h4>Introduction<\/h4>\r\nStart by giving an overview of the topic and providing context on why someone would be comparing the two items. Keep this section short so that the reader can quickly get to the comparison.\r\n<h4>What is X<\/h4>\r\nThe next paragraph typically has an H2 that reads \u201cwhat is X.\u201d This is a good way to target related keywords that will also have decent search volume.\r\n\r\nThe first sentence of this paragraph should answer the question directly. Here you explain, \u201cX is\u2026\u201d and then elaborate.\r\n<h4>Pros and Cons of X<\/h4>\r\nAfter explaining what X is, you\u2019ll go into detail about the cost and benefit of using X. It could be helpful to break this into two sections. One would be titled, \u201cPros of X\u201d with a bulleted list and the other would be titled \u201cCons of X\u201d with a bulleted list.\r\n<h4>What is Y<\/h4>\r\nOnce you\u2019ve fully explained X, you can move on to Y. Use the H2, \u201cWhat is Y.\u201d Then answer the question directly and add additional details to fully explain Y.\r\n<h4>Pros and Cons of Y<\/h4>\r\nHere you\u2019ll list the costs and benefits of using Y. Use a bulleted list so that the section can easily be scanned.\r\n<h4>X vs. Y<\/h4>\r\nNow that you\u2019ve detailed each item, it\u2019s time to compare the two. The best way to do this is in a chart with qualifications. For example, in <a href=\"https:\/\/casper.com\/blog\/king-vs-queen-bed\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">this post comparing king vs. queen bed sizes<\/a>, both the images and charts consider relatable visualizations, dimensions, prices, and pros vs. cons. Comparing these factors helps the reader decide which option is best for them.\r\n<h4>Conclusion<\/h4>\r\nIf there is one option that\u2019s better for everyone, state this in the conclusion. If the best option depends on the situation, sum up which option is better for which type of person.\r\n\r\nDownload the free blog post template for an X vs. Y post here:\r\n\r\n<a href=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/06\/X-vs-Y-Post-Template.docx\"><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-20733 size-medium\" src=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/06\/download-word-doc-button-400x74.png\" alt=\"button that says download word doc\" width=\"400\" height=\"74\" \/><\/a>\r\n\r\n<a href=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/06\/X-vs-Y-Post-Template.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-20732 size-medium\" src=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/06\/download-pdf-button-400x74.png\" alt=\"button that says download pdf\" width=\"400\" height=\"74\" \/><\/a>\r\n<a name=\"beginners-guide-post\"><\/a>\r\n<h2>7.

Infographic Post Template<\/h2>\r\nInfographics have a bad reputation. With mediocre design, poor linking and off-topic ideas, infographics can hurt your blog strategy. On the other hand, if you target useful topics and create shareable designs, <a href=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/creation\/why-and-how-infographics-work\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">infographics can be a game changer<\/a>.\r\n\r\nHere are some questions to ask yourself when deciding if an infographic is right for your blog:\r\n<ul>\r\n \t<li>Does the topic benefit from a visual representation?<\/li>\r\n \t<li>Will an infographic provide useful information that others will want to share?<\/li>\r\n \t<li>Do you have the resources? Whether that\u2019s access to a design team that can create a <a href=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/services\/infographic-design\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">stellar infographic design<\/a> or the time and skills to make your own.<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n<h3>Infographic Post Examples<\/h3>\r\nSome infographic posts are structured with a short introduction and then an infographic. These are created to be shareable and can help you build links to the site.\r\n\r\nOther posts have an infographic added on to one of the blog post templates mentioned above. These are aiming to rank for a keyword and build links to the site.\r\n\r\nLook through these blog post examples of infographic posts in different industries:\r\n<ul>\r\n \t<li>Travel: <a href=\"https:\/\/www.carrentals.com\/blog\/romantic-road-trips\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">19 Places for Your First Romantic Road Trip<\/a><\/li>\r\n \t<li>Insurance: <a href=\"https:\/\/bestow.com\/blog\/how-to-make-friends-as-an-adult\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">How to Make Friends as an Adult<\/a><\/li>\r\n \t<li>Human Resources: <a href=\"https:\/\/www.resume-now.com\/job-resources\/interviews\/video-interview-tips\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">13 Video Interview Tips for a Job-Winning First Impression<\/a><\/li>\r\n \t<li>Construction: <a href=\"https:\/\/www.bigrentz.com\/blog\/pop-culture-structures-costs\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">The Costs of Building Iconic Pop Culture Structures<\/a><\/li>\r\n \t<li>Lifestyle: <a href=\"https:\/\/www.hellorory.com\/roar\/eye-contact\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">The Power of Eye Contact<\/a><\/li>\r\n \t<li>Floral: <a href=\"https:\/\/www.ftd.com\/blog\/design\/air-purifying-plants\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">The Perfect Air Purifying Plants for Your Space<\/a><\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n<h3>What to Include in an Infographic Post<\/h3>\r\nAs you can see there are a few ways to structure infographic posts. We have a simple infographic blog post template, but you can adjust based on your blog style and goal.\r\n\r\n<img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-20737 size-large\" src=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/06\/infographic-post-template-388x1024.png\" alt=\"graphic of infographic blog post template outline\" width=\"388\" height=\"1024\" \/>\r\n<h4>Title<\/h4>\r\nThe title of your infographic post should describe the topic. Depending on your industry, you may decide to feature your infographic offering in the title.\r\n\r\nFor more technical industries like business or finance, structuring it as \u201cTITLE [INFOGRAPHIC]\u201d could make the post title more clickable. When writing for lifestyle industries, switch the wording so it says visual rather than infographic. For example, \u201cTOPIC with Visual Guide\u201d could tell your readers that there\u2019s an additional asset.\r\n<h4>Introduction<\/h4>\r\nThis should have a hook that pulls the reader in. Then include background information on the topic and why it relates to your reader.\r\n\r\nIf you are creating a full post with the infographic at the end, it could be helpful to include a <a href=\"https:\/\/wordpress.com\/support\/splitting-content\/page-jumps\/\">page jump-to<\/a> that takes the reader quickly to the infographic. This way, those who want an overview can quickly jump down without having to scroll all the way down.\r\n<h4>Body<\/h4>\r\nIf you are solely trying to create a linkable asset, the body of your infographic post may be on the shorter side. That said, you want to avoid creating thin content. The more additional information you add, the more valuable the post will be to a reader.\r\n\r\nNot sure what to include? Try structuring this section in the same format as your infographic. Instead of concise bullet points like your infographic features, elaborate on the topics. This way those who have additional questions can look to the body of the post for answers.\r\n<h4>Infographic<\/h4>\r\nNext comes the infographic.

    "content": "It doesn\u2019t matter how great your content is if no one clicks on it\u2014and it all starts with your blog title.\r\n\r\nStuck on how to come up with a good title? I don\u2019t blame you. A blog title is the first, and sometimes only, to draw your readers in.\r\n\r\nA great blog title sets the expectation for the content within your post, but also helps create a curiosity gap so readers want to click through and learn more. It\u2019s what will differentiate your post among your competitors in the search results.\r\n\r\nHowever, a catchy blog title is more than just standing out. It can increase click-through-rate (CTR) and in turn, drive your blog traffic.\r\n\r\nOur <a href=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/creation\/blog-post-templates\">blog posts<\/a> at Siege drive more than 10,000,000 visits per month. Through that work, we've learned several blog title frameworks proven to deliver results. In this post, we'll share each of them including 40+ examples you can port over to your own business.\r\n\r\n<strong>Blog Title Ideas<\/strong>\r\n<ul>\r\n \t<li><a href=\"#list\">List Post Title<\/a><\/li>\r\n \t<li><a href=\"#how-to\">How To\u2026 Title<\/a><\/li>\r\n \t<li><a href=\"#what\">What, Why or How?<\/a><\/li>\r\n \t<li><a href=\"#this\">This vs. That<\/a><\/li>\r\n \t<li><a href=\"#data\">Data-Backed Title<\/a><\/li>\r\n \t<li><a href=\"#long-form\">Long Form Guide Title<\/a><\/li>\r\n \t<li><a href=\"#parentheses\">(Parentheses) or [Brackets]<\/a><\/li>\r\n \t<li><a href=\"#against\">Against Popular Belief Title<\/a><\/li>\r\n \t<li><a href=\"#answers\">Title That Answers a Question<\/a><\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n<h2>What Makes a Great Blog Title?<\/h2>\r\nA great blog title grabs your attention and urges you to want to learn more. It should be optimized for SEO, match the intent of your target audience, have a concise purpose and set clear expectations. Easy, right? Not always.\r\n\r\nCrafting a blog title is a bit of a balancing act between creative brainstorming, keyword research and analysis. Yet, the extra time spent on analyzing can be worth the effort\u2014the number one organic result is <a href=\"https:\/\/backlinko.com\/google-ctr-stats\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">10x more likely<\/a> to receive a click and gets 31.7% of all clicks.\r\n\r\nTo help guide your blog title creation, we\u2019ve created a formula that contains <strong>four components<\/strong> to consider. Because industries and topics vary, it's not one size fits all. Simply use this as a framework while brainstorming.\r\n\r\n<img class=\"alignnone wp-image-20777 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/06\/blog-title-formula.png\" alt=\"Blog title formula\" width=\"1401\" height=\"325\" \/>\r\n\r\nLet\u2019s break down the four components and why they matter.\r\n<h3>Keyword<\/h3>\r\nOptimize your post title with a keyword. The title or <a href=\"https:\/\/moz.com\/learn\/seo\/title-tag\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">title tag<\/a> is how the search engine and the reader determine if your post is relevant for the results.\r\n\r\nPlacing important keywords at the beginning of your title can not only impact rankings, but people typically scan as few as the <a href=\"https:\/\/moz.com\/learn\/seo\/title-tag\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">first two words<\/a> of a headline. When crafting a title, remember to write for humans, not the search engine. Avoid keyword stuffing and deoptimize slightly by including a number or adjective\u2014over-optimization can also take away from <a href=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/seo\/how-to-rank-higher-on-google\">high rankings<\/a>.\r\n<h3>Purpose<\/h3>\r\nIt may seem obvious, but a great blog title tells the reader what to expect. What is your post actually about and what\u2019s the point of your content?\r\n\r\nAvoid clickbait headlines that over exaggerate and ultimately leave you disappointed as a reader. No one enjoys clicking on a title, only to find that the content doesn\u2019t align with what the title promised.\r\n<h3>Value<\/h3>\r\nWhy should someone read your post? Provide insight into what they will learn or gain from your article if they keep reading.\r\n\r\nKeep in mind a great blog title is nothing if there's not actionable, valuable or in-depth information to follow after you click through.\r\n<h3>Action (or Adjective)<\/h3>\r\nGet readers excited about the value of your content. Spice up an otherwise bland title with a call to action, catchy adjective or the use of alliteration.\r\n\r\nHowever, it's important to note that people can see through the BS. Avoid including words that come across as spammy or pushy. Words like easy, simple, need, now, must, free, amazing or secret can actually <a href=\"https:\/\/cdn2.hubspot.net\/hub\/53\/file-2505556912-pdf\/Data_Driven_Strategies_For_Writing_Effective_Titles_and_Headlines.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">hurt CTRs<\/a>.\r\n\r\nIf this formula isn\u2019t your jam, there are many other <a href=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/services\/copywriting\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">copywriting<\/a> formulas you might find useful to guide creating your blog titles.\r\n<ul>\r\n \t<li><strong>AIDA<\/strong>: Attention, Interest, Desire, Action<\/li>\r\n \t<li><strong>PAS<\/strong>: Problem, Agitate, Solution<\/li>\r\n \t<li><strong>IDCA<\/strong>: Interest, Desire, Conviction, Action<\/li>\r\n \t<li><strong>ACCA<\/strong>: Awareness, Comprehension, Conviction, Action<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n<h3>Check Out Your CTRs<\/h3>\r\nCTR tells you the percentage of people who see your post in the search results and click through to learn more. It\u2019s a helpful metric to check out if a post isn\u2019t bringing in traffic or performing the way you\u2019d like.\r\n\r\n<img class=\"alignnone wp-image-20778 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/06\/check-out-your-CTR.png\" alt=\"Google search console graph and metrics\" width=\"1401\" height=\"575\" \/>\r\n\r\nPull this data via <a href=\"https:\/\/search.google.com\/search-console\/about\">Google Search Console<\/a> to tweak or test out different title options based on the results. Compare posts that have high impressions and high clicks to high impressions and low clicks to narrow down what\u2019s worked\u2014or what hasn\u2019t.\r\n<h2>Blog Title Ideas<\/h2>\r\nFrom backyard brunch ideas to B2B insurance topics, check out the types of blog titles that we\u2019ve seen the most success with across all industries.

It lays out steps, strategies or tips to make a process or complicated thing easy to understand. These titles often start with a number to make the post length clear to the reader.\r\n\r\nHow do you determine a number for your title? Be strategic with what you include and how you curate your list. Analyze the SERP to see what\u2019s currently ranking for the topic. It will depend on the topic, but keep in mind that sometimes less is more.\r\n\r\n<img class=\"alignnone wp-image-20782 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/06\/list-post-title.png\" alt=\"Listicle blog post title elements\" width=\"1402\" height=\"600\" \/>\r\n\r\nHere are some list post title examples:\r\n<ul>\r\n \t<li>50 Bullet Journal Ideas to Keep Your Life on Track<\/li>\r\n \t<li>13 Foods For a Better Mood and Reduced Anxiety<\/li>\r\n \t<li>Edible Wedding Favors: Fall in Love with 45 Delicious Ideas<\/li>\r\n \t<li>5 Content Marketing Trends to Follow in 2020<\/li>\r\n \t<li>106 Must-Know Startup Statistics for 2020<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h3>How To...

What to avoid here is validating an idea with something that looks like social proof, but isn\u2019t.\r\n\r\nLet\u2019s say we\u2019re a consumer-facing website that helps find apartments and we\u2019re trying to validate an idea for a post about apartment decorating ideas.\r\n\r\nEven though the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.google.com\/search?q=apartment+decorating+ideas&amp;oq=apartment+decorating+ideas&amp;aqs=chrome.0.69i59j0l7.1224j0j9&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">SERP<\/a> looks great in terms of LRDs, you can see that the popular posts are from online publications with extremely high domain authorities.\r\n\r\n<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-20657\" src=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/06\/apartment-decorating-ideas.png\" alt=\"apartment-decorating-ideas\" width=\"1400\" height=\"783\" \/>\r\n\r\nThis gives us a hint that it may not be realistic to try and create this post as a promotable, seeing as the LRDs are generated on highly credible, highly linkable, sites.\r\n\r\nIdeally, a good promotable idea will look like something like this in the SERP:\r\n\r\n<img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-20655 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/06\/pet-resume.png\" alt=\"pet-resume-serp\" width=\"1400\" height=\"792\" \/>\r\n\r\nHere we see websites that have a similar offering, relatively low domain authority and plenty of links that show people are interested in this topic.\r\n\r\nBetter still, is that one of the posts generating significant links is relatively thin with some stock imagery.\r\n\r\n<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-20656\" src=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/06\/rentberry-pet-resume.png\" alt=\"rentberry-pet-resume\" width=\"1400\" height=\"787\" \/>\r\n\r\nThis is a good sign that this topic can be built out to be bigger and better and generate the same, if not more, links.\r\n<h2><b>Create: Building Content That Ranks<\/b><\/h2>\r\nYou\u2019ve analyzed your current web content strategy and validated content ideas.\r\n\r\nNow it\u2019s time to put the legwork in.\r\n\r\nTo create something that publishers will want to share and Google recognizes as an answer to searcher intent, the content needs to be showstopping.\r\n\r\nA strategic marketing process is only as good as the content it generates. This is where the infamous <a href=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/seo\/skyscraper-technique\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">skyscraper technique<\/a> comes in.\r\n\r\nBecause web content development has gotten a rap for pumping out mediocre pieces, it\u2019s likely that your post has already been done in some capacity. That doesn\u2019t mean you can\u2019t give value to your readers, though.\r\n\r\nBy <a href=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/strategy\/increase-website-traffic\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">creating content<\/a> that answers more questions, is more visually appealing or more user friendly\u2014you\u2019re adding value to what already exists.\r\n<h2><b>Promote: Generating Quality Links<\/b><\/h2>\r\nYou\u2019ve successfully identified and validated topics worth creating and subsequently built a beautiful piece of content.\r\n\r\nSo the hard part\u2019s over, right?\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, without promotion, much of that time and effort creating content is wasted on an incomplete content development strategy.\r\n\r\nEveryone wants links these days, which makes link building extremely competitive.\r\n\r\nSo much so that people pay good money for them. Not only is that an unsustainable strategy for content development, but it will nearly always get you penalized in some capacity.\r\n\r\nInstead, you want to generate natural links on quality sites that are relevant to the topic of the post you\u2019re sharing.\r\n\r\nIt\u2019s time to throw out those mass-sent, cold outreach emails that leave us with the same aura as leaving a car dealership.\r\n\r\nIf we\u2019ve learned anything as the Internet has evolved, it\u2019s that people want interaction with <i>people<\/i>.\r\n\r\nMay I present to you, being human:\r\n\r\n<img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-20654 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/06\/outreach-email.png\" alt=\"outreach-email\" width=\"1400\" height=\"1330\" \/>\r\n\r\nBelieve it or not, 50 personalized emails will go much further than 150 mass-sent emails. That\u2019s because most people on the internet have been around and see through link-building schemes.\r\n\r\nInstead, you need to bring them relevant and useful content that they recognize as helpful to their audience. Not every piece of content needs to be promoted, nor should it. <a href=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/marketing\/manual-link-building\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Top-funnel assets<\/a> are more linkable than bottom-funnel ones, and the value of those links continue to accrue long-term.\r\n<h2><b>Optimize: Maintaining Relevant Web Content<\/b><\/h2>\r\nOptimization is key to a content development strategy that builds passive links and maintains your traffic.\r\n\r\nUpdating content to continue to remain relevant, and improving SEO when applicable, can generate continuous traffic long after the original posting date.\r\n\r\nExample A. This interactive statistics post by <a href=\"https:\/\/www.nextiva.com\/blog\/customer-service-statistics.html\">Nextiva<\/a> generates passive links year after year (at the time of writing, it boasts 323 LRDs.)\r\n\r\n<img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-20653 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/06\/nextiva-service-stats.png\" alt=\"nextiva-service-stats\" width=\"1400\" height=\"801\" \/>\r\n\r\nPerform a <a href=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/seo\/content-audit\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">content audit<\/a> to find opportunities to improve on-page SEO for existing posts. For example, the statistics post above should be revisited annually to update the data (delete stale data points or add new ones) to remain relevant.\r\n\r\nYou can refurbish this strategy with evergreen content by making sure the information is up to date.\r\n\r\nGenerally, you should aim to avoid being *that guy* on the SERP that searchers scroll past after seeing the aged date of the post.\r\n<h2><b>TL;DR<\/b><\/h2>\r\nContent development done successfully consists of ideation, validation, execution, promotion and optimization of top-funnel content.\r\n\r\nSound like a lot of work? I\u2019m not going to lie to you\u2014it is. But we do it time and time again because we know that this <a href=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/services\/content-marketing\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">content marketing<\/a> strategy, works.\r\n\r\nThese research and development process steps have doubled our client\u2019s traffic (more than once), and that\u2019s being modest. We\u2019ll be the first to admit that content development is not for the faint of heart, but it\u2019s always worth it.\r\n\r\nMay the best user-focused content development strategy, win!"

    "content": "Whether you've recently launched a blog or your blog posts aren\u2019t bringing you any value, we turned years of experience creating content as a 115-person agency into 12 steps that will help you write a good blog post.\r\n\r\nA brand\u2019s blog is an important pillar of the business. It\u2019s a channel for customers to understand the story behind your brand, build your brand's image and online presence and, ultimately, understand more about who your customers are.\r\n\r\nIt\u2019s not enough to write blog posts just to keep your blog updated. We\u2019ve helped numerous brands grow their search presence, organic traffic and customer base through their blog content\u2014even growing three blog\u2019s organic traffic from 0 per month to 500K per month in the <a href=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/strategy\/increase-website-traffic\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">matter of two years<\/a>.\r\n\r\nHere\u2019s our exact process used to drive the traffic through actionable blog posts, distilled into 12 easy-to-understand steps.\r\n<h2>1. Define Your Audience<\/h2>\r\nWhether you\u2019re working with a small business or a Fortune 500 brand, you can\u2019t get your message across without knowing who you\u2019re writing for.\r\n\r\nIf you don\u2019t yet have buyer personas or a representation of your ideal customer, start by identifying who makes up this group of people. Here are some ways that you can uncover who your customer is:\r\n<ul>\r\n \t<li><strong>Examine your email database<\/strong>: If you\u2019ve captured emails from current or prospective customers, dive into how you got these leads to identify who the customers are.<\/li>\r\n \t<li><strong>Analyze your organic traffic<\/strong>: Look through your traffic to understand how people are finding your site through your acquisitions.<\/li>\r\n \t<li><strong>Ask the sales team<\/strong>: Your sales team has insight into the customers they\u2019re interacting with the most. Pick their brain. If you\u2019re on a small team, consider what group of people has been largely interested in your product or service.<\/li>\r\n \t<li><strong>Hold one-on-one conversations<\/strong>: Talk to your customers. Understand more about them through one-on-one conversations to learn more about who they are.<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\nJot down demographics that define them such as their age, gender, location, occupation and any other details you can gather.\r\n\r\nOnce you understand your audience better, you\u2019ll be able to write blog posts that answer their biggest questions and concerns. The value you deliver will keep them coming back to your blog and can, in turn, win them over as valued customers.\r\n\r\nLet\u2019s take a look at a brand who clearly mapped their blog posts to their ideal customer: <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theknot.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">The Knot.<\/a>\r\n\r\nThe Knot offers tools that help couples with wedding planning, from the engagement to becoming newlyweds. They\u2019ve identified their audience and continue to deliver blog content that speaks to them with how-to guides and tips to walk them through the entire wedding planning process.\r\n\r\n<img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-20391 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/05\/1-understand-audience-1-scaled.jpg\" alt=\"the knot blog\" width=\"2560\" height=\"725\" \/>\r\n\r\nThe more blog posts you write, the better you\u2019ll understand who your audience is through comments and emails from your readers.\r\n<h2>2. Nail Down a Topic<\/h2>\r\nSelect a topic that will be engaging to your audience in conjunction with taking steps towards your <a href=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/services\/content-marketing\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">content marketing<\/a> and business goals.\r\n\r\nFirst, take a look at your competitors to see what type of <a href=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/services\/content-creation\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">content they\u2019re creating<\/a> that could also resonate with your audience. The simplest way to do this is to search for your product or service offerings and see what brands are ranking for it.\r\n\r\nFor example, if you\u2019re a company that refinances student loans, you could search \u201cstudent loan refinancing,\u201d which results in companies such as NerdWallet, SoFi, Credible, Earnest and more. These are competitors who write blog posts with similar goals in mind to you. From here, you can dive into their content to inspire topics for your blog post.\r\n\r\nHere are some tools you can use to help you find a topic for your blog post:\r\n<ul>\r\n \t<li><a href=\"https:\/\/www.semrush.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><strong>SEMRush<\/strong><\/a>: Dive deep into what\u2019s converting best for your competitors and use your expertise to write a blog post that does an even better job of answering search intent.<\/li>\r\n \t<li><strong><a href=\"https:\/\/ahrefs.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Ahrefs<\/a><\/strong>: Run a content gap analysis to understand what you\u2019re not ranking for, but your competitors are.<\/li>\r\n \t<li><strong><a href=\"https:\/\/buzzsumo.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">BuzzSumo<\/a><\/strong>: Learn more about what topics are performing best in your industry and capitalize on it.<\/li>\r\n \t<li><strong><a href=\"http:\/\/reddit.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Reddit<\/a><\/strong>: Use threads that are related to your brand to inspire content ideas.<\/li>\r\n \t<li><a href=\"https:\/\/news.google.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><strong>Google News<\/strong><\/a>: Identify news in your industry or related to your product offering.<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\nLearn more about selecting a topic through content strategy from our <a href=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/seo\/content-strategy\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">process for building 250K+ monthly visits<\/a>.\r\n<h2>3. Consider Your Distribution Method<\/h2>\r\nYou understand your audience and have picked a topic to write about. Now it\u2019s time to ask yourself: <em>how will someone read this?<\/em>\r\n\r\nThis question is often overlooked (and even by major brands). And that\u2019s often how some blog posts end up missing the mark.\r\n\r\nWe consider the distribution method upfront to help shape our blog post with our reader\u2019s in mind. These are the possible angles your blog post distribution method could stem from:\r\n<ul>\r\n \t<li><strong>Your email and social media audience<\/strong>: If you have built up an audience, it\u2019s a no brainer to share your content with them. However, if not, it\u2019s even more important that you lean on the below points.<\/li>\r\n \t<li><strong>Rank through organic search<\/strong>: If you don\u2019t yet have an audience, going after search is a great way to build one. Target an attainable and fitting <a href=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/seo\/kwr-emerging-trends\">keyword research<\/a> for your blog post.<\/li>\r\n \t<li><strong>Egobait outreach<\/strong>: If you reference or quote someone in your blog post, you\u2019ve opened up the perfect opportunity to <a href=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/marketing\/link-building-model\">notify them about your post<\/a> when it\u2019s live. This could lead to a link on their site or a mention through their social media page.<\/li>\r\n \t<li><strong>Cold email outreach<\/strong>: Choose a topic that warrants other sites to link to you through actively pitching them once it\u2019s live.<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\nYou\u2019re not limited to one approach, but your blog post will be much stronger if you\u2019re prepared for distribution prior to the writing stage.\r\n<h2>4. Write Your Title<\/h2>\r\nNow that you understand your audience and have selected a topic, you\u2019re ready to start your blog post. Begin by brainstorming title ideas to help guide your post by analyzing the search engine results page (SERP) for your targeted keyword. There you can understand what titles are used for top-performing content and shape your title around that.\r\n\r\nWhat\u2019s most important to consider? Click-through rate (CTR), or the ratio of users who click on your blog post. Your title is your first impression. It will help the searcher decide if they want to click on your blog post.\r\n\r\nThere are five elements that drive clicks\u2014low price, freshness, brand, volume and speed. Every blog post uses at least one of these elements, and some even use two to three.\r\n\r\n<img class=\"alignnone wp-image-20625 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/06\/title-tag-diagram.png\" alt=\"title tag click through rate diagram\" width=\"1906\" height=\"1356\" \/>\r\n\r\nWe go into detail about <a href=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/seo\/title-tags\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">how to improve title tag CTR in a separate blog post<\/a>.\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Once you have some title options, make sure to consider how long your title is<\/span>\u2014preferably less than 60 characters, so it doesn't get cut off on the SERP. For example, when you search the trending topic \u201cwhipped coffee,\u201d you can see this title being cut off for being too long.\r\n\r\n<img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-20386 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/05\/2-write-your-title-scaled.jpg\" alt=\"whipped coffee serp\" width=\"2560\" height=\"1640\" \/>\r\n\r\nOnce you have a few attention-grabbing title options, you\u2019re ready to outline your blog post.\r\n<h2>5. Outline Your Blog Post<\/h2>\r\nA key component to writing a good blog post is by organizing your thoughts in an outline before writing the post. The structure will help keep you on track in the writing process and will help you rank for your intended keyword.\r\n\r\nStart your outline by including the expected URL, meta description, category and more at the top for quick reference. Then, include the title options at the top with placeholders for the body.\r\n\r\nConsider what format will best appeal to your readers such as a listicle, news piece, infographic, long-form guide, etc.\r\n\r\nFeel free to use <a href=\"https:\/\/docs.google.com\/document\/d\/12nJOx3Mx15OoCAuJqJe2j-ixJvEKskgID6rKE2VCt-o\/edit?usp=sharing\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">this template<\/a> to start your blog post.\r\n<h2>6. Do Your Research<\/h2>\r\nYou have the opportunity to gain the trust of your readers with thorough and thoughtful research. Research supporting points, run a survey or source unique quotes to back up your points and guide your writing.\r\n\r\nHere are some credible sources you can use to find information:\r\n<ul>\r\n \t<li><strong>Scholarly sources<\/strong>: Use scholarly databases like <a href=\"https:\/\/scholar.google.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Google Scholar<\/a>, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.lexisnexis.com\/en-us\/gateway.page\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">LexisNexis<\/a> and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.ebsco.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">EBSCO<\/a> to find trusted journals and studies.<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\nOur go-to when researching my survey-driven blog posts is Google Scholar since we can quickly find related studies to back up the findings. For example, say I ran a survey revealing how many college students had cheated on an exam in the past and got away with it. I\u2019d then turn to Google Scholar to see if there are any studies that I can use to back up my findings through tailored searches like \u201ccheating on tests,\u201d \u201cacademic cheating,\u201d and \u201cethics of cheating,\u201d which I\u2019d narrow down to the current year.\r\n\r\n<img class=\"alignnone wp-image-20537 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/05\/google-results-blurred.png\" alt=\"Google Scholar search results\" width=\"2364\" height=\"1073\" \/>\r\n<ul>\r\n \t<li><strong>Government sites<\/strong>: Government websites have loads of information available to the public, but it can sometimes be difficult to dig up. Use strategic search queries to locate the information you need such as: car emissions inurl:.gov \u201c2019\u201d.<\/li>\r\n \t<li><strong>Credible news sources<\/strong>: Refer to trusted publications for credible information such as <a href=\"https:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">The New York Times<\/a>, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.washingtonpost.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">The Washington Post<\/a> and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.bloomberg.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Bloomberg<\/a>.<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\nIf you\u2019re looking for unique quotes, reach out to experts in the field you\u2019re covering. Here are some ways to source expert quotes:\r\n<ul>\r\n \t<li><strong>Search strings<\/strong>: You can find experts who have covered specific topics through search operators such as: \u201cfinancial expert\u201d title:loans. Once you have the expert\u2019s name, you can search for their personal website or reach out to them via LinkedIn or Twitter to request a quote.<\/li>\r\n \t<li><strong>HARO<\/strong>: You can use <a href=\"https:\/\/www.helpareporter.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Help a Reporter Out<\/a> (HARO) to ask for a quote in a mass email to PR folks, many of whom represent experts in various fields.<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\nDoing your research before the writing phase will allow you to shape your story before fully writing it. And, since it takes time to source quotes or run a survey, it\u2019s helpful to start the process before writing your blog post to see what you can come up with.\r\n<h2>7. Write Your Blog Post<\/h2>\r\nNow\u2019s the time: write your blog post!\r\n\r\nFollow your outline and write without stopping to edit too frequently. Remember that your first draft doesn\u2019t need to be perfect\u2014it\u2019s all about getting the words down and editing thereafter.\r\n\r\nKeep your formatting top-of-mind in the writing process. Break up your piece with paragraph breaks, subheadings or bullets to allow readers to easily follow (or skim) your copy.\r\n\r\nHere are some tools that will help you write your piece:\r\n<ul>\r\n \t<li><strong><a href=\"https:\/\/www.apstylebook.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">AP Stylebook Online<\/a><\/strong>: Quick guidance on English grammar style and usage.<\/li>\r\n \t<li><a href=\"https:\/\/www.grammarly.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><strong>Grammarly<\/strong><\/a>: An English language tool that uses artificial intelligence to improve your writing.<\/li>\r\n \t<li><a href=\"https:\/\/www.thesaurus.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><strong>Thesaurus<\/strong><\/a>: Can\u2019t find the word you\u2019re looking for? Thesaurus is a great tool to quickly find synonyms.<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\nOnce you write the meat of your piece, return to the introduction and make sure it\u2019s a true representation of your blog post.\r\n<h2>8. Edit Your Blog Post<\/h2>\r\nNo matter how experienced a writer you are, it\u2019s always encouraged to edit your blog post.\r\n\r\nEven if you don\u2019t have a designated editor on your team, we recommend getting another set of eyes on your piece. For example, in addition to having editors on staff, all writers are paired with an editing buddy to give a first pass at editing each other's work. You can also turn to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.upwork.com\/hire\/proofreaders\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Upwork<\/a> and hire an hourly proofreader.\r\n\r\nThroughout the editing process, the aim is to:\r\n<ul>\r\n \t<li><strong>Analyze structure<\/strong>: Make sure that your blog post is easy to follow and in a digestible order.<\/li>\r\n \t<li><strong>Proofread<\/strong>: Spell check doesn\u2019t catch everything\u2014confirm that everything is spelled correctly and grammatically correct.<\/li>\r\n \t<li><strong>Ensure style and tone alignment<\/strong>: Make sure your piece follows the brand guidelines.<\/li>\r\n \t<li><strong>Guarantee clarity<\/strong>: Confirm that you\u2019re getting your point across to the reader with clear and concise copy.<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\nOnce your piece is edited, you\u2019re ready to move onto the visual component of creating a good blog post.\r\n<h2>9. Add Design Elements<\/h2>\r\nUsing design elements in your blog post makes it easily digestible for readers. Plus, you don\u2019t need a big budget to make this happen.\r\n\r\nStock photos or screenshots are a great way to break up your post for free.\r\n\r\nHere are some free stock photo options:\r\n<ul>\r\n \t<li><a href=\"https:\/\/unsplash.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Unsplash<\/a><\/li>\r\n \t<li><a href=\"https:\/\/gratisography.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Gratisography<\/a><\/li>\r\n \t<li><a href=\"https:\/\/pixabay.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Pixabay<\/a><\/li>\r\n \t<li><a href=\"https:\/\/www.pexels.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Pexels<\/a><\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\nAlthough we utilize stock photos, we always choose the image with intention and with a priority to avoid \u201coverly stock\u201d photos. \u201cOverly stock\u201d photos feel cheap, less polished and take away credibility. Photos that exhibit true-to-life qualities such as natural lighting, composition and realistic subjects will not only be appreciated by the viewer, but will also project a higher degree of trustworthiness.\r\n\r\n<img class=\"alignnone wp-image-20538 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/05\/stock-image-comparison.png\" alt=\"stock image comparison\" width=\"1500\" height=\"1469\" \/>\r\n\r\nAdding a visual component will take your blog post to the next level.\r\n<h2>10. Optimize for SEO<\/h2>\r\nIn addition to optimizing for SEO while writing your piece, there are optimizations you don\u2019t want to miss when you get close to publishing to help your blog post rank. These include:\r\n<ul>\r\n \t<li>Optimizing your <a href=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/seo\/title-tags\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">title tag<\/a>, URL and meta description<\/li>\r\n \t<li>Utilizing long-tail keywords<\/li>\r\n \t<li>Adding alt-text to your images<\/li>\r\n \t<li>Adding internal <a href=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/marketing\/link-valuation\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">links<\/a> to your other blog posts<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\nFor more SEO advice, refer to our post on <a href=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/strategy\/seo-tips\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">actionable SEO tips<\/a>.\r\n<h2>11. Insert a Clear Call to Action<\/h2>\r\nAdding a call to action (CTA) circles back to the first step of understanding your audience.\r\n\r\nA CTA is a prompt to tell your readers what to do next\u2014whether that be reading another related post, sharing on social media, signing up for a newsletter or another way to move them down the funnel.\r\n\r\nYou already have their attention, so this is the opportunity to continue showing your value as a brand in a strategic way. CTAs should have actionable, short text and good design, and they should trigger a sense of urgency in your reader.\r\n\r\nAn example of a brand that does this well throughout their blog post is Slack. In a blog post that <a href=\"https:\/\/slackhq.com\/lessons-from-a-decades-long-remote-worker\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">shares lessons from a decades-long remote worker<\/a>, they have a simple design component at the bottom of the post that encourages readers to register for a webinar on working remotely using their software.\r\n\r\n<img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-20387 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/05\/3-CTA-a-scaled.jpg\" alt=\"slack cta\" width=\"2560\" height=\"1200\" \/>\r\n\r\nOr, take a look at how <a href=\"https:\/\/www.madewell.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Madewell<\/a> captures emails and gender in their footer, which appears below blog posts and shopping.\r\n\r\n<img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-20388 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/05\/4-CTA-b-scaled.jpg\" alt=\"madewell cta\" width=\"2560\" height=\"927\" \/>\r\n\r\nWhatever your CTA tactic may be, don\u2019t miss the chance to convert your reader to a customer.\r\n<h2>12. Watch Your Customers Convert<\/h2>\r\nA blog post is successful if it\u2019s purposeful, captures your audience's attention, establishes trust and helps convert your reader into a customer. If you consistently replicate the process of writing a good blog post, you\u2019ll be on your way to a successful content marketing strategy.\r\n\r\nIf all of this sounds hard to do or a little too time intensive for you to execute, check out our <a href=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/services\/content-creation\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">content creation services<\/a> to get help from an agency with proven experience."

    "title": "Content Marketing Interview Questions from Hiring 100+",
    "content": "When I became a manager, interviewing applicants was my least favorite part of the job. The rehearsed answers to \u201cwhere do you see yourself in five years?\u201d left me feeling like I never got a realistic picture of a potential new hire.\r\n\r\nInterviewing took me time \u2014 and plenty of mistakes along the way \u2014 to master. In 2021 alone, we spoke with 140+ candidates (and those were just the people we decided were worth talking to on the phone). We hired 30 people from that batch throughout the year (that\u2019s roughly three new hires a month!). On the flip side, our turnover was only 17 people for the year.\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/01\/CleanShot-2021-11-29-at-15.12.01@2x-400x188.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"400\" height=\"188\" class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-26694\" \/>\r\nFrom our interview experience, we\u2019ve built a framework that we\u2019ve iterated and improved upon with each person we\u2019ve talked to and hired.\r\n\r\nOur hiring success isn\u2019t only attributed to our interview process (training plays a huge role in this too) \u2014 I firmly believe proper vetting from the start sets our company (and the new hire) up for long-term success. I <a href=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/strategy\/hire-content-marketers\">detailed our hiring process<\/a> on our blog earlier, so if you want to see a full picture of our entire process (it\u2019s roughly five steps) watch my video first. Here I\u2019m going to share the interview questions we\u2019ve crafted that help us cut through the candidate B.S.\r\n<h2>Why You Need Interview Questions<\/h2>\r\nBefore diving in, it\u2019s worth noting that some managers prefer to \u201cwing it\u201d or have an interview be mostly candid conversation. I can understand that \u2014 leaving out the formality will cut the potential for a bland, overly polished conversation (which is what frustrated me in my early days of interviewing).\r\n\r\nBut, unfortunately, very few managers and non-HR professionals can pull this off successfully. It results in too many \u201ctrash\u201d questions \u2014 from the predictable \u201cwhat are your strengths and weaknesses?\u201d to the absurd \u201chow many cows could fit in a 10,000 acre farm?\u201d\r\n\r\nI find the perfect mix for a 30-minute interview is having five to 10 \u201cmust ask\u201d job function questions, one to three \u201cculture fit\u201d questions and some time at the end for them to ask questions.\r\n\r\n<img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-19304\" src=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/01\/interview-question-ratio.png\" alt=\"function vs. fit question ratio\" width=\"620\" height=\"232\" \/>\r\nSome other general rules I\u2019ve learned over time:\r\n<ul>\r\n \t<li><strong>It\u2019s OK to interrupt someone.<\/strong> Some candidates are long winded, so feel comfortable politely interrupting them if you feel their answers are going off track. I\u2019ll usually say, \u201cThanks for your detail. I\u2019m most interested in what you shared about [XYZ]...\u201d and go from there.<\/li>\r\n \t<li><strong>Make sure your questions are different enough from your colleagues\u2019.<\/strong> Your candidates should be interviewing with more than one person at the company. With that, compare your questions across the team for minimal overlap. We take it a step further and provide each manager with a personalized \u201cquestion bank\u201d to follow.<\/li>\r\n \t<li><strong>Create a post-interview scorecard.<\/strong> This is an easy way to summarize the entire team\u2019s thoughts on an applicant, which you can then dive in to if needed. We use a \u201cfit, fire, function\u201d score on a scale from one to five (one = extremely poor, five = excellent). Anyone with an average of three or higher we discuss, below we let them go.<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n<img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-19305\" src=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/01\/post-interview-scorecard.png\" alt=\"interview scorecard\" width=\"508\" height=\"295\" \/>\r\n<h2>13 Interview Questions for Hiring Content Marketers<\/h2>\r\nThe <a href=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/careers\">core role we hire for<\/a> is content marketing specialist. Most of our employees come in at the junior or entry level position, but these questions could also be modified for senior and manager roles.\r\n<h3>Job Function Questions<\/h3>\r\n<strong>Question 1: What content are you not interested in writing professionally?<\/strong>\r\n\r\nMaybe they work in medical copywriting now and would like a new challenge. Or they\u2019ve struggled writing on complex financial topics. I appreciate it when an applicant is honest about their weaknesses so we can ensure we pair them with the right client fit.\r\n\r\n<strong>Question 2: Who is involved in the content creation process at your current job?<\/strong>\r\n\r\nWhat is the team size? Are they expected to churn out content without much supervision or is there a lot of input from a manager or editor? Neither process is bad, but you can get insight on how closely it matches the way your business likes to work.\r\n\r\n<strong>Question 3: One of our core values is \u201cquality over profit.\u201d Tell me about a time in your writing career where you reflected that value.<\/strong>\r\n\r\nWe care about the quality of work we create and we want that reflected in the candidates we hire. We\u2019re not interested in writers who want to cut corners or save themselves some time.\r\n\r\n<strong>Question 4: What type of content do you have experience creating?<\/strong>\r\n\r\nSee if they name content you know they\u2019ll be writing consistently or if it\u2019s just a rambling list of content you don\u2019t create.\r\n\r\n<strong>Question 5: Looking at your test project, did it feel familiar? Were you able to use past experience to complete it?<\/strong>\r\n\r\nI highly recommend having some kind of test project, like a short, 200-word writing prompt for them to complete before the interview. Here you can try to get some honest answers from them on what came easy to them versus what took some extra time.\r\n\r\n<strong>Question 6: Tell me about a time your work received a lot of feedback. How did you handle it?<\/strong>\r\n\r\nWith client work, you never know what type of client you\u2019ll get (hands on, hands off, balanced). We look for candidates who keep a positive attitude when given feedback.\r\n\r\n<strong>Question 7: How do you approach writing about a topic you\u2019re not an expert in?<\/strong>\r\n\r\nWe have clients in all industries \u2014 from home decor and travel to construction and cybersecurity. Our specialists will also move accounts or juggle more than one client at a time that could be in vastly different industries, so hearing their research process is important.\r\n\r\n<strong>Question 8: Your first month here will involve a lot of training, but what is something new that you could teach us?<\/strong>\r\n\r\nMaybe they\u2019re teaching themselves Python on the side. Or they have experience writing for non-English speakers. Whatever it may be, I believe there\u2019s something you can learn from every new hire.\r\n\r\n<strong>Question 9: What toolset are you using to complete your writing?<\/strong>\r\n\r\nDoes it match what your company uses? Will they be overwhelmed with the new technology or adapt to it? Answers can vary from editing extensions like Grammarly to keyword research methods.\r\n\r\n<strong>Question 10: Give a brief summary of the role and see how they react.<\/strong>\r\n\r\nThis isn\u2019t a question, per se, but we\u2019ve found it useful to be 100% transparent about the expectations of the role early in the process and get their immediate feedback. Candidates are excited to speak to you and willing to please, so be frank about what some core challenges of the role are so no assumptions are made on day one.\r\n<h3>Culture Fit Questions<\/h3>\r\nWhile not something you\u2019d immediately think about when hiring content marketers, culture fit can be equally (if not more) important. A star performer will mean nothing if they can\u2019t collaborate with your team. Below are some questions we like to ask that reflect our company culture.\r\n\r\n<strong>Question 1: Give me an example of when you went above and beyond the needs of a project.<\/strong>\r\n\r\nMany of our core values reflect putting in the extra effort to deliver for a client. You can also pick up on what the candidate cares most about when they define \u201cabove and beyond\u201d work. For example, was it helping out a fellow coworker when they were out on vacation, staying late to finish up a project or uncovering a new topic opportunity for a client?\r\n\r\n<strong>Question 2: What was a low point during your last job? How did you get out of it?<\/strong>\r\n\r\nAgain, their answer to this will show you what they care most about in their career. Answers could include stagnation in their growth, reporting to a manager they didn\u2019t have a good relationship with or moving to a new city and struggling to make it.\r\n\r\n<strong>Question 3: Tell me about a time you disagreed with a manager or client. How did you handle it?<\/strong>\r\n\r\nOur environment is collaborative and not everyone will have the same viewpoint on how one thing should get done. We listen carefully to tone and how they explain how they worked through the issue.\r\n<h2>How to Write Interview Questions<\/h2>\r\nEven if the questions above don\u2019t match your company or needs, crafting interview questions shouldn\u2019t mean Googling around and copying from the top-ranking articles. If you\u2019re doing that to form the majority of your interview, then your candidate is doing the same to craft their answers.\r\n\r\nThese questions were crafted from trial and error, but I also found it helpful to list out core competencies to help us target \u201cA Players.\u201d This strategy is outlined in <em><a href=\"https:\/\/whothebook.com\/\">Who<\/a><\/em>, which I recommend to anyone looking for hiring tips (although not all of them are applicable to modern hiring needs).\r\n\r\nFigure out five to 10 core competencies for an excellent hire by asking yourself and talking to your management team. Not a good hire \u2014 an <em>excellent<\/em> one. Below is a list I compiled and used to spark interview question ideas:\r\n<ul>\r\n \t<li><strong>Organization and planning<\/strong> - Maintain control of workload and deadlines. Ability to schedule and plan in an efficient, productive manner. Focuses on key priorities.<\/li>\r\n \t<li><strong>Intelligence<\/strong> - Learns quickly. Demonstrates ability to quickly understand and absorb new information.<\/li>\r\n \t<li><strong>Flexibility<\/strong> - Adaptable. Adjusts quickly to changing priorities and conditions.<\/li>\r\n \t<li><strong>Enthusiasm<\/strong> - Exhibits passion and excitement for work.<\/li>\r\n \t<li><strong>Work ethic<\/strong> - Possess a strong willingness to work hard to get the job done.<\/li>\r\n \t<li><strong>Communication<\/strong> - Speaks and writes clearly and articulately.<\/li>\r\n \t<li><strong>Creativity<\/strong> - <a href=\"https:\/\/deanyeong.com\/reading-note\/linchpin\/\">Linchpin mindset<\/a>. Generates new and innovative approaches to problems.<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\nThe same exercise can be done for any discipline at any leadership level to help you determine what questions get to the core of what you need.\r\n<h2>How We Judge Content Marketing Interviewees<\/h2>\r\nPreparing an interview list ahead of time frees you from having to think about the next question you\u2019re going to ask once you\u2019re in the interview. All this effort means nothing if you don\u2019t closely listen to their answers.\r\n\r\nWhile a candidate is answering my questions, I\u2019ll keep a running tab of these checkpoints in my head:\r\n<ul>\r\n \t<li>Was that answer sufficient? Was there something I was unclear on that I should follow up with?<\/li>\r\n \t<li>Did their body language or tone change at all between certain questions?<\/li>\r\n \t<li>What question(s) did they struggle to answer? How did they handle it?<\/li>\r\n \t<li>Did they act differently when answering job function questions vs. culture fit questions?<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\nFinally, I find some of the most valuable intel not from their answers to my questions, rather <strong>the questions they ask me<\/strong>. You can immediately tell which candidates have researched your company as opposed to those who have Googled \u201cgood follow up interview questions.\u201d Asking me a generic \u201chow long have you worked at Siege Media?\u201d is not as exciting compared to someone asking me \u201chow does Siege Media onboard new clients?\u201d\r\n<h2>It\u2019s a \u201cHell Yes\u201d Or No<\/h2>\r\nYou may talk to a lot of average candidates: like applicants who seem solid and check a few boxes and those who you think you can look past shortcomings because you really need this position filled. This choice ends up coming back to bite you.\r\n\r\nWe try to remind ourselves time and time again that if it\u2019s not a \u201chell yes,\u201d it\u2019s a no.

Prioritize a Harmonious Blog Setup<\/h3>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/10\/dos-and-donts-of-blog-setup.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1400\" height=\"1400\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-29790\" \/>\r\n\r\nOne of the most important components of an e-commerce content strategy is your blog setup \u2014 unfortunately, we see a lot of e-commerce sites getting this wrong. \r\n\r\nThe biggest pitfall we\u2019ve seen is that many e-commerce sites build their blog on a subdomain that\u2019s completely disconnected from the main site. \r\n\r\n<blockquote class=\"definition\">To create a natural shopping experience, it\u2019s important to pull your main navigation and main footer onto your blog. Your blog should feel similar to your main site and a lack of harmony can actually hurt conversion rates. \r\n<\/blockquote>\r\n\r\nUsers should be able to easily head to your main site to view your products, and if it\u2019s not easily accessible because your content lives on a subdomain, they\u2019re likely going to bounce. \r\n\r\nUltimately, you want to make the shopping experience as easy and natural as possible. \r\n\r\n<h3 id=\"content-hub\">2. Build a Content Hub<\/h3>\r\n\r\nA content hub is a place that houses a collection of content all in one place, organized by specific topics relevant to your brand and your customer base. \r\n\r\nInstead of organizing your blog in the typical chronological order, having specific categories can help users find exactly what they\u2019re looking for at whatever stage of the buyer's journey they\u2019re in. \r\n\r\n<blockquote class=\"definition\">The purpose of content hubs is to help solve new and potential customer problems and provide useful, valuable information and content. Content hubs can include blog posts, downloadable templates, quizzes, generators, and more.<\/blockquote>\r\n\r\nLet\u2019s take <a href=\"https:\/\/www.zola.com\/expert-advice\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Zola\u2019s<\/a> advice hub for example. \r\n\r\nThe content hub breaks down into a variety of categories that meet their target customers at every step of their journey, including planning, decor, invites, pre-wedding activities, registry, and honeymoon. \r\n\r\n<img src=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/10\/zola-advice-hub.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1400\" height=\"460\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-29798\" \/>\r\n\r\n<h3 id=\"video-content\">3. Utilize Video Content<\/h3>\r\n\r\nVideo content is becoming more and more prevalent online, with users turning to search engines like YouTube to find engaging and most of all entertaining content. \r\n\r\n<blockquote class=\"definition\">Videos are an extremely effective part of a content strategy, even more so for e-commerce brands, as they <strong>educate customers about their products and push them further down the sales funnel<\/strong>.<\/blockquote>\r\n\r\nA study from Lemonlight found that <a href=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/strategy\/content-marketing-statistics#ch6\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">94% of people<\/a> said they use video to make a purchasing decision. \r\n\r\nThe proof is in the pudding \u2014 video content is the sweet spot for e-commerce brands. \r\n\r\nThere are so many types of videos you can create to showcase your products, from how-to videos and tutorials to product reviews and expert advice, the possibilities (and creativity) are endless.\r\n\r\nTommy John\u2019s video on <a href=\"https:\/\/www.tommyjohn.com\/blogs\/news\/how-to-fold-underwear\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">how to fold underwear<\/a> provides a solution to a common customer query while showcasing their products. \r\n\r\n<img src=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/10\/tommy-john-video-content.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1400\" height=\"1020\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-29797\" \/>\r\n\r\n<h3 id=\"product-photos\">4. Use Product Photos Within Your Content<\/h3> \r\nThis may be an obvious one, but make sure you\u2019re including product photos within your content.  \r\n\r\n<blockquote class=\"definition\">A <a href=\"https:\/\/citeseerx.ist.psu.edu\/viewdoc\/download?doi=10.1.1.648.6208&rep=rep1&type=pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">study<\/a> from eBay Research Lab found that more product photos actually <strong>help increase buyers\u2019 trust and attention while boosting conversion rates<\/strong>.<\/blockquote>\r\n\r\nYou\u2019re selling products after all, so you want to highlight them any chance you get. High-quality product photos can be used on product pages, on social media, and in blog posts. \r\n\r\nLet\u2019s look at Pottery Barn Kids\u2019 post on <a href=\"https:\/\/www.potterybarnkids.com\/tips-and-ideas\/pbk\/nursery-organization\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">nursery organization<\/a> as an example. \r\n\r\nThis blog post provides a ton of useful tips on how to organize a nursery, with product photos that can spark interest for potential customers. \r\n\r\nWhen users are inspired by the tips you share, they\u2019re more likely to click on the product you included in the post. \r\n\r\n<img src=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/10\/pottery-barn-kids-product-photos.gif\" alt=\"\" width=\"600\" height=\"429\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-29800\" \/>\r\n\r\n<h3 id=\"buying-guides\">5. Create Buying Guides<\/h3> \r\nBuying guides are another great strategy for e-commerce companies as they allow you to subtly put your products in front of potential customers. \r\n\r\nNot only will customers be comparing your products to your competitors toward the end of their buying journey, but they\u2019ll also be looking for product information that can help them make a purchasing decision. \r\n\r\n<blockquote class=\"definition\">Buying guides can provide customers with useful information like <strong>price, characteristics, functionality, and any other key product features<\/strong>.<\/blockquote>\r\n\r\nYou can create buying guides for nearly any kind of product and can take a seasonal approach and create seasonal buying guides for popular holidays, like Mother\u2019s Day, Christmas, and Valentine\u2019s Day. \r\n\r\nShutterly\u2019s post on <a href=\"https:\/\/www.shutterfly.com\/ideas\/creative-mothers-day-gifts\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Mother\u2019s Day Gifts<\/a> is the perfect example of a great buying guide that puts your products in front of customers when they're searching for the perfect gift.\r\n\r\nIn the screenshot below, we can see spikes in traffic around April and May, when users are typically researching Mother\u2019s Day Gifts. \r\n\r\n<img src=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/10\/shutterfly-organic-traffic.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1400\" height=\"540\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-29795\" \/>\r\n\r\n<h3 id=\"visually-engaging-content\">6. Leverage Visually Engaging Content<\/h3>\r\nOne thing e-commerce has a leg up on compared to other industries \u2014 like finance, for example \u2014 is that content can be a lot more visually engaging. \r\n\r\nWith e-commerce, content is usually a lot more entertaining, so <a href=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/marketing\/creative-content\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">creative content <\/a> types that are engaging and interactive are going to help attract customers to your site. \r\n\r\nThere are so many different content formats e-commerce sites can leverage, including:\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Infographics<\/li> \r\n<li>High-quality product photos<\/li>\r\n<li>Quizzes<\/li>\r\n<li>Generators<\/li> \r\n<li>Downloadable templates<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\nThis hair color quiz from <a href=\"https:\/\/www.styleseat.com\/blog\/what-color-dye-hair\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">StyleSeat<\/a> is a great example of engaging and <a href=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/creation\/interactive-content\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">interactive content<\/a> that can attract their target audience. \r\n\r\n<img src=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/10\/style-seat-quiz.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1400\" height=\"1060\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-29796\" \/>\r\n\r\n<h3 id=\"shareable-content\">7. Make Your Content Shareable<\/h3> \r\nSo you just created a killer piece of content, now how do you get eyes on it? \r\n\r\nFirst things first, you need to make sure the content you create is shareable. If it is, people will likely share it without much leg work on your part. \r\n\r\nNot only does sharing get your brand and your products out there, it can also help you gain relevant backlinks to these pages. \r\n\r\nBacklinks are an important part of SEO because they help boost your rankings on the SERPs while increasing your authority.\r\n\r\nOver time, your content can continue to earn backlinks so you can continue reaping the benefits for years to come. \r\n\r\nLet\u2019s look at Proflower\u2019s post on <a href=\"https:\/\/www.proflowers.com\/blog\/how-to-make-a-balloon-arch\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">how to make a balloon arch<\/a>, which currently has 73 linking root domains (LRDs). This how-to post not only uses photos to explain every step of the arch-making process, it also has an infographic and video, increasing the likelihood of someone sharing. \r\n\r\n<img src=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/10\/proflower-shareable-content.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1400\" height=\"1230\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-29793\" \/>\r\n\r\n<h3 id=\"comparison-pages\">8. Build Comparison Pages<\/h3>\r\nCreating pages dedicated to comparing your brand against your competitors may not be the first thing you think of when it comes to <a href=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/creation\/content-creation\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">content creation<\/a>, but they\u2019re actually one of the most effective pieces of content for e-commerce websites. \r\n\r\n<blockquote class=\"definition\">Comparison pages are your way of prompting potential buyers to purchase your products over your competitors.<\/blockquote>  \r\n\r\nWhen users are nearing the end of the buyer\u2019s journey, they naturally start doing their research by comparing similar products. \r\n\r\nBy optimizing pages to include keywords targeting your product or brand name against your competitors, customers will be able to easily find you when searching for this information on Google. \r\n\r\nFor example, <a href=\"https:\/\/casper.com\/casper-vs-purple\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Casper<\/a> has multiple pages dedicated to comparing their mattresses against their top competitors. \r\n\r\nAs you can see, they do a great job breaking down all of the important information a customer would be looking for \u2014 like pricing, comfort, construction, and type of material they use. \r\n\r\nTo put the icing on the cake, they include customer reviews towards the end of the page. I don\u2019t know about you, but I\u2019m more likely to buy a product with a ton of raving customer reviews than one without. \r\n\r\n<img src=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/10\/casper-comparison-page.gif\" alt=\"\" width=\"600\" height=\"429\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-29799\" \/>\r\n\r\n<h3 id=\"cta-shopping\">9. Integrate Shopping into CTA\u2019s and Blog<\/h3>\r\n<blockquote class=\"definition\">A <strong>CTA<\/strong>, or <strong>call to action<\/strong>, is one of the easiest and most important ways e-commerce websites can guide customers toward a purchase.<\/blockquote>  \r\n\r\nSince you\u2019re selling products, you want to center your CTAs around shopping. At the end of the day, your goal is for your <a href=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/creation\/high-converting-content\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">content to convert<\/a>. \r\n\r\nCTAs don\u2019t need to be in your face, but they\u2019ll help push users toward your product offerings if they\u2019re looking to learn more. You can include these within posts, or simply make sure your header navigation provides easy access to product pages.  \r\n\r\nHave you ever been on a page where the CTA is following you while you scroll and it\u2019s actually more of a distraction than it is enticing? \r\n\r\nYou want to avoid this and only include CTAs where they are relevant to the buyer\u2019s journey. \r\n\r\nTake <a href=\"https:\/\/www.rei.com\/blog\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">REI<\/a>, for example: They seamlessly integrate shopping CTAs within their content where it makes sense without being overly pushy. \r\n\r\n<img src=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/10\/rei-cta-integration.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1400\" height=\"810\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-29794\" \/>\r\n\r\n<h3 id=\"faq-or-help-center\">10. Provide an FAQ Page or Help Center<\/h3>\r\nHaving a frequently asked questions (FAQ) page is an invaluable strategy for e-commerce brands. \r\n\r\nThough they\u2019re not the most creative or interactive content types, they\u2019re effective and extremely useful for e-commerce marketing.\r\n\r\nThe last thing you want is for a potential customer to leave your site and move to a competitor because they couldn\u2019t find an answer to their question. \r\n\r\n<blockquote class=\"definition\">Aside from answering common customer queries, FAQ pages can <strong>help build trust with customers, improve site navigation, improve search engine rankings,<\/strong> and <strong>build your brand\u2019s authority<\/strong>.<\/blockquote> \r\n\r\nTake <a href=\"https:\/\/kitchencabinetkings.com\/faq.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Kitchen Cabinet Kings<\/a>. Their FAQ page is organized by topics \u2014 like ordering, construction, and delivery \u2014 and includes answers to common questions that both potential and existing customers may ask. \r\n\r\n<img src=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/10\/kck-faq-page.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1400\" height=\"880\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-29791\" \/>\r\n\r\n<h2>Ready To Execute Your E-commerce Content Strategy?<\/h2> \r\nContent marketing is one of the most effective ways e-commerce companies can make sales and increase their ROI. \r\n\r\nOnce you\u2019re able to reel in your customers with engaging content, you\u2019ll have them hooked and ready to make repeat purchases. \r\n\r\nConsistent posting, top-notch design elements, and A+ content writing are what it takes to execute a proper content strategy. We can help you stay competitive. \r\n\r\nIf you\u2019re ready to invest in an e-commerce content strategy that can impact your business for years to come, Siege offers <a href=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/services\/content-marketing\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">content marketing services<\/a> that can help you get the most out of your investment.

Understand the Business Environment<\/h3>\r\n<img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-27916\" src=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/08\/key-questions-for-your-content-strategy-1.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1400\" height=\"1220\" \/>\r\n\r\nIt can\u2019t be overstated that an SEO-driven content marketing strategy is meant to drive more <b>valuable<\/b> traffic to your business. To do that, you need to understand your market and your brand\u2019s position within it.\r\n\r\nWhen starting a new SEO content strategy, spend the first few weeks building out a plan that covers:\r\n<ul>\r\n \t<li>Your overall sitewide content strategy<\/li>\r\n \t<li>Your brand overview and value proposition<\/li>\r\n \t<li>Your market overview and competitor analysis<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\nLooking at your existing sitewide content strategy helps uncover any issues that impact overall SEO performance.\r\n\r\nNext, it\u2019s important to have an in and out understanding of your website\u2019s brand and value proposition. You should be able to clearly define:\r\n<ul>\r\n \t<li>Who you are as a business<\/li>\r\n \t<li>What you\u2019re trying to accomplish<\/li>\r\n \t<li>Why someone should choose your business over alternatives<\/li>\r\n \t<li>Who your target audience is<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\nSetting a content strategy shouldn\u2019t happen in a vacuum. Yet, <a href=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/strategy\/content-marketing-statistics\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">40% of B2C content marketers<\/a> only look at competitors once per year (or not at all). Studying what your competition looks like online can give you an advantage.\r\n\r\nTo understand a company\u2019s competitors\u2019 content strategy, you should look at:\r\n<ul>\r\n \t<li>What competitors are doing well<\/li>\r\n \t<li>What competitors are ranking for<\/li>\r\n \t<li>Which topics bring a site\u2019s competitors the most traffic<\/li>\r\n \t<li>How long it takes a competitor to rank for a given topic<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\nThis can help you make more efficient content planning decisions. Knowing what works for your competitors reduces the need to spend on trial and error.\r\n\r\nFor a more complete picture of the competitive landscape, we also recommend using tools like <a href=\"https:\/\/ahrefs.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Ahrefs<\/a>. To better understand how much you need to invest in your content strategy, you can compare your site\u2019s metrics like:\r\n<ul>\r\n \t<li>Domain Rating (DR)<\/li>\r\n \t<li>Linking root domains (LRDs)<\/li>\r\n \t<li>Organic keywords<\/li>\r\n \t<li>Monthly organic traffic<\/li>\r\n \t<li>Organic traffic value<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\nLooking at traffic value should also help you set reasonable expectations for your content strategy. You can answer questions like:\r\n<ul>\r\n \t<li>What is the total addressable market?<\/li>\r\n \t<li>How much real growth is possible?<\/li>\r\n \t<li>Where are the most relevant, high-value content ideas?<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\nWith this roadmap handy, you can find the most valuable opportunities for your brand. This is where keyword opposition to benefit (KOB) analysis is a huge difference-maker.\r\n<h3>2. Find High Value Topics Using KOB<\/h3>\r\nIf you\u2019ve read any material on digital marketing or SEO, you\u2019re aware of keyword research. Typical recommendations are that you target either high search volume (SV) or low SV, low-difficulty keywords in your field.\r\n\r\nHigh SV keywords are great, but they\u2019re also highly competitive and expensive. Even the highest authority websites (DR &gt;90) will find it challenging to rank for these terms.\r\n\r\nLow SV\/low-difficulty keywords are also great and can offer a few chances to rank quickly. The problem is you\u2019re limiting yourself by exclusively focusing on these terms.\r\n\r\nYour goal should be finding valuable traffic and ranking opportunities. SV or keyword difficulty alone won\u2019t give you the full picture.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/strategy\/kob-analysis\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">KOB analysis<\/a> is a more strategic approach that compares keyword difficulty to what people are willing to spend on that content.\r\n\r\nThis should help you:\r\n<ul>\r\n \t<li>Find and pick \u201clow-hanging fruit\u201d keywords<\/li>\r\n \t<li>Prioritize topics where our clients can rank quickly at each stage of the buyer funnel<\/li>\r\n \t<li>Achieve a sizable ROI<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n<img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-27832\" src=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/kob-analysis-siege-media.gif\" alt=\"\" width=\"1280\" height=\"720\" \/>\r\n\r\nThis has a compounding effect over time. As your site ranks for more topics, your domain authority will grow. This makes the higher SV and difficulty keywords more attainable down the road.\r\n\r\nRoss Hudgens offers a more in-depth look at this process in this video:\r\n<div class=\"video-container\"><iframe title=\"YouTube video player\" src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/bZe771lsU6c\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"><\/iframe><\/div>\r\nYou can also <a href=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/05\/KOB-Keyword-Research.xlsx\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">download our free KOB analysis spreadsheet<\/a> to help you get started.\r\n\r\nOnce you\u2019ve identified your topics and keywords, it\u2019s time for the fun part: creating share-worthy content your audience will love.\r\n<h3>3. Build an SEO Roadmap<\/h3>\r\n<img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-27918\" src=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/08\/seo-roadmap-checklist.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1401\" height=\"1877\" \/>\r\n\r\nWhen creating share-worthy content, you want to have a plan that allows for maximum efficiency and impact.\r\n\r\nUse the findings from your KOB research and preliminary content strategy to start building a content plan. You also want to consider factors like:\r\n<ul>\r\n \t<li>Your site\u2019s authority<\/li>\r\n \t<li>What kind of content ranks in your industry<\/li>\r\n \t<li>Key performance indicators (KPIs)<\/li>\r\n \t<li>Outreach markets<\/li>\r\n \t<li>Seasonal content topics<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\nEven if your organization has an unlimited budget, you want to prioritize any existing strong passive link opportunities in your vertical.\r\n<ul>\r\n \t<li>Strong passive link opportunities = topics with multiple results that have 100+ links<\/li>\r\n \t<li>These topics have potential to earn valuable links without additional spending on manual link generation<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\nFor greater time efficiency, you can also try to find scaleable content areas.\r\n\r\n<b>Example:<\/b> Keywords that overlap under a broader topic.\r\n\r\n<b>Solution:<\/b> Organize the content calendar around topics.\r\n\r\nA topic-focused content calendar saves on time and cost. Instead of creating one post per keyword, you can target topics that have the potential to rank for multiple keywords.\r\n\r\nOur team leverages <a href=\"https:\/\/www.clearscope.io\/\">Clearscope<\/a> as a powerful tool to help ensure our content best-serves the consumer and also has the greatest potential in rankings.\r\n\r\nWith your calendar in mind, it\u2019s time to start <a href=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/conversation\/how-to-brainstorm-content-effectively\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">brainstorming shareable content ideas<\/a> ideas. In order to make your content stand out for your audience, you should consider:\r\n<ul>\r\n \t<li>Is this unique from your competitors?<\/li>\r\n \t<li>Does this solve a problem for the user?<\/li>\r\n \t<li>Will this resonate emotionally with the audience?<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\nBe sure to establish a consistent voice within your area of expertise. This helps build your brand reputation and consumer trust over time. For best results, it\u2019s important that your content:\r\n<ul>\r\n \t<li>Focuses on topics for which you can be considered an authoritative source<\/li>\r\n \t<li>Contains messaging that aligns with your core values<\/li>\r\n \t<li>Follows consistent design and copywriting guidelines<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\nAs you\u2019re developing content, passive and manual link acquisition will be key drivers of organic traffic. Here\u2019s how you can plan ahead and think strategically about that process.\r\n<h3>4. Identify Your Link Building Strategy<\/h3>\r\nYou\u2019re likely aware that links are an important part of SEO and page rankings. Google views these as a \u201cstamp of authority\u201d for a website, so we want to acquire quality links passively or through manual outreach.\r\n\r\nPassive links:\r\n<ul>\r\n \t<li>Come from other websites finding and linking to your web pages organically<\/li>\r\n \t<li>Signal that your business is seen as an authority on the topic<\/li>\r\n \t<li>Prove that you\u2019ve created something worthy of sharing<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\nThe beauty of an SEO-driven content marketing strategy is if you\u2019ve built quality content, it should accumulate passive links over time.\r\n\r\nThis video does a great job of explaining the process in detail:\r\n<div class=\"video-container\"><iframe title=\"YouTube video player\" src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/mxEzl81jS-4\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"><\/iframe><\/div>\r\nWhile you want to prioritize content that has strong passive link potential, there are times when manual outreach is needed. Meaning, you actively market your content to relevant blogs in your vertical so they may share with their audience.\r\n\r\nFor example:\r\n<ul>\r\n \t<li>If your site is newer and building your domain rating, manual outreach can jumpstart the link acquisition process.<\/li>\r\n \t<li>Your competitors have significantly more backlinks and you want to build your own backlink profile.<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\nOnce you have a link acquisition plan, you need to establish benchmarks to measure the tangible impact of your content.\r\n<h3>5. Establish Metrics and Begin Reporting<\/h3>\r\nIf you\u2019re relying solely on content marketing, success might just be measured by the number of links you gain or your traffic growth. Successful SEO content marketing takes into account the 360-degree view of your competitors and the true value of your marketing strategy.\r\n\r\nTools like <a href=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/creation\/content-marketing-tools\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Ahrefs<\/a> or <a href=\"https:\/\/semrush.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">SEMrush<\/a> provide real-time data to create S.M.A.R.T. (Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant and Time-bound) goals to work towards.\r\n\r\nHere\u2019s a quick example:\r\n<ul>\r\n \t<li>Ahrefs domain comparison shows a competitor\u2019s webpage has 500 more LRDs than yours.<\/li>\r\n \t<li>You would like to overtake them within one year.<\/li>\r\n \t<li>To do so, you calculate that you need to gain 42 links per month.<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\nYou can use tools like <a href=\"https:\/\/analytics.google.com\/analytics\/web\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Google Analytics<\/a> and <a href=\"https:\/\/search.google.com\/search-console\/about\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Google Search Console<\/a> to track how your site and new content pages are helping to achieve your goals.\r\n\r\n<img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-27920\" src=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/08\/suggested-metrics-to-track.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1401\" height=\"1223\" \/>\r\n\r\nYour goals may change over time, but this data lets you know where you should continue optimizing to reach them.\r\n<h3>6. Update Content and User Experience<\/h3>\r\nSEO content marketing is not a \u201cset it and forget it\u201d strategy. Once your content starts getting more traffic, you want to make sure it <a href=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/creation\/high-converting-content\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">actually converts<\/a>.\r\n\r\nWhen you have a sufficient sample size, assess the following to make strategic decisions:\r\n<ul>\r\n \t<li>Is your overall traffic growing?<\/li>\r\n \t<li>Which pages are driving the most traffic?<\/li>\r\n \t<li>Where are your pages ranking?<\/li>\r\n \t<li>Which topics are popular? Which aren't?<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\nFrom there, look at CTR and bounce rates to learn more about how your visitors are interacting with your site. Ask yourself:\r\n<ul>\r\n \t<li>How long are they staying on the site?<\/li>\r\n \t<li>What do they do once they\u2019re there?<\/li>\r\n \t<li>Which pages have strong and weak conversion rates?<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\nYou can use this information to emphasize higher-performing topics in your future content plans. You can also find opportunities to enhance the user experience by:\r\n<ul>\r\n \t<li>Prioritizing high-performing content in the site structure<\/li>\r\n \t<li>Adjusting low-performing content to resemble high-performing page structure<\/li>\r\n \t<li>Making blog posts with &gt;10% conversion rates landing pages<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\nAn SEO content marketing strategy also incentivizes you to keep your content fresh. This is another opportunity to leverage Clearscope as you can quickly identify <a href=\"https:\/\/www.clearscope.io\/guides\/refresh\">keyword opportunities when refreshing content<\/a>.\r\n\r\nWe often recommend revisiting pages at least once a year to see if they can be updated with new statistics or developments to make them more relevant.\r\n\r\nYou\u2019ll be amazed by the results when you put these steps into practice. Check out <a href=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/work\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">some of our work<\/a> for proof!\r\n\r\nWe\u2019ve covered a high-level look at what goes into an effective SEO content marketing strategy.

    "content": "According to The Radicati Group, there are almost <a href=\"https:\/\/www.radicati.com\/wp\/wp-content\/uploads\/2012\/10\/Email-Market-2012-2016-Executive-Summary.pdf\">6 billion <\/a>unique email addresses in the world. So when you really need to find someone\u2019s email, can you really rely on guessing?\r\n\r\nOf course not. In the business and marketing world, we can\u2019t boost sales, increase web traffic, or run successful campaigns unless our contact receives our email. And most of the time, the biggest barrier to is simply not being able to find their email address.\r\n\r\nThankfully, many tools have surfaced to make the task of being able to find an email easier and more scalable.\r\n\r\nWe\u2019ve found that we have the most success if we can reach the blogger or journalist directly, rather than just a standard <a href=\"mailto:info@site.com\">info@site.com<\/a> or contact form. While there are many factors that go into getting the email recipient to actually open and read your email, contacting them via their preferred channel is the first step.\r\n\r\nBelow is a list of 10 techniques that our team has had the most success with. They are listed as separate tips, but many can be used in conjunction with others to verify and validate findings. Follow these steps to find someone\u2019s email address almost every time.\r\n<div class=\"video-container\"><iframe src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/DVucnskute0\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"><\/iframe><\/div>\r\n<h2>Step 1: Google Search Operators<\/h2>\r\n<img class=\"aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/10\/Screen-Shot-2013-10-15-at-9.11.42-AM.png\" alt=\"Screen Shot 2013-10-15 at 9.11.42 AM\" width=\"530\" height=\"250\" \/>\r\n\r\nAs a first step, go with the basics \u2013 mining Google using search operators. Here are just a few of our favorites for finding webmaster contact information in addition to the Twitter one mentioned above.\r\n<ul>\r\n \t<li>NAME email<\/li>\r\n \t<li>NAME contact<\/li>\r\n \t<li>\"FIRSTNAME LASTNAME\" email<\/li>\r\n \t<li>\"FIRSTNAME LASTNAME\" contact<\/li>\r\n \t<li>site:WEBSITE.com name email<\/li>\r\n \t<li>site:WEBSITE.com contact<\/li>\r\n \t<li>site:WEBSITE.com about<\/li>\r\n \t<li>\"NAME\"<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\nThere are a lot of other operators out there that can be helpful\/drill down more, but for the most part, the above four will pick up the majority of the email addresses, if they're out there.\r\n\r\nThe \"NAME\" query is particularly useful for finding contact information on other domains your contact may work on\/own, in case you can't find the contact info on the first website you search through.\r\n<h2>Step 2: Try Hunter to Find Verified Email Addresses for Free<\/h2>\r\n<a href=\"https:\/\/hunter.io\/?via=ross\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Hunter<\/a> provides a bunch of tools that make automating the email address look-up process easy.\r\n\r\nYou can use the <a href=\"https:\/\/hunter.io\/email-finder\/?via=ross\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Email Finder<\/a> if you have the full name of your prospect and the company name. Just type in the information in a search bar, and you'll get a verified email address in seconds.\r\n\r\n<img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-25443\" src=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/03\/hunter-email-finder.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1760\" height=\"1449\" \/>\r\n\r\nHunter also offers a <a href=\"https:\/\/hunter.io\/chrome\/?via=ross\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Chrome extension<\/a> to find the email addresses behind the websites you're browsing, while <a href=\"https:\/\/hunter.io\/author-finder\/?via=ross\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Author Finder<\/a>, helps discover the contact information of the authors behind specific articles.\r\n\r\nPlus, Hunter provides 25 free email lookups and 50 verifications per month.\r\n<h2>Step 3: Use Buzzstream<\/h2>\r\n<a href=\"http:\/\/buzzstream.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Buzzstream<\/a> helps find on-page emails as well as uncover social media profiles of influencers. Similar to Hunter.io, this tool can be installed as Chrome plugin, but also as a standalone web app. If it can't find the email address you need, you could still cross reference their social media profiles for email address mentions.\r\n\r\n<img class=\"aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/10\/buzz.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1627\" height=\"568\" \/>\r\n<h2>Step 4: Find a Pattern<\/h2>\r\nOne of the most useful pieces of Hunter.io or Buzzstream is that they can help identify a common email pattern. However, there are several other options for identifying patterns if those don't work. For example,\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.email-format.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Email Format<\/a>\u00a0helps uncover patterns based on the domain name that you input.\r\n\r\n<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-12792\" src=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/10\/email-format.png\" alt=\"how to find someone's email with email format\" width=\"1183\" height=\"461\" \/>\r\n\r\nThis searches the web for any email addresses for a given domain, returning addresses for whomever it can find for that company \u2013 giving you some obvious clues about what the email of your preferred contact might be.\r\n\r\nThis pattern-matching is best for medium to large sized companies with decent age, as these companies had enough time to pick up a common email format and also put their email addresses somewhere public on the internet.\r\n\r\nOnce you know the pattern, you a try a manual search which we outline more extensively below.\r\n<h2>Step 5: Use Email Permutator with Linkedin Sales Navigator<\/h2>\r\nYou could type in every permutation of a person\u2019s name until it syncs \u2014 or you can use the Email Permutator.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"https:\/\/docs.google.com\/spreadsheets\/d\/17URMtNmXfEZEW9oUL_taLpGaqTDcMkA79J8TRw4xnz8\/edit?usp=sharing\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Email Permutator<\/a> is a Google Sheet that\u2019s been around for a bit and created by Rob Ousbey, formerly of Distilled, now VP Strategy at <a href=\"https:\/\/moz.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Moz<\/a>.

Hunter.io listed above will verify the email address by telling you if it is deliverable. You get 100 free verification requests per month and then you are prompted to upgrade your account.\r\n\r\nHowever, if you run out, there are a few more options for verifying email address deliverability:\r\n<ul>\r\n \t<li><a href=\"http:\/\/verify-email.org\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">http:\/\/verify-email.org\/<\/a><\/li>\r\n \t<li><a href=\"https:\/\/neverbounce.com\/email-verification\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">https:\/\/neverbounce.com\/email-verification<\/a><\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n<img class=\"aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/10\/verifyemail.png\" alt=\"how to find someones email by verifying\" width=\"984\" height=\"692\" \/>\r\n\r\nThese are especially helpful if you are unsure if someone still works at a company or if a website seems very old.\r\n\r\nEach tool offers a varying degree of success and all have limits to their free use. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.emailhippo.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">EmailHippo<\/a> offers notes within the results that reveal the degree of trust you should have for that email.\r\n\r\nIf these have failed you thus far, you can use Google search operators to power your way through.\r\n<h2>Step 7: Search Twitter Feed via Google<\/h2>\r\n<img class=\"aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/10\/Screen-Shot-2013-10-15-at-9.10.04-AM.png\" alt=\"Screen Shot 2013-10-15 at 9.10.04 AM\" width=\"555\" height=\"93\" \/>\r\n\r\nThis advanced search operator was originally brought to my attention by <a href=\"http:\/\/www.seerinteractive.com\/blog\/how-to-find-anyones-email-using-allmytweets\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Emma Still<\/a> and Gaz Copeland \u2013 it\u2019s a smart and stupidly effective way of finding the email address of someone A) in demand and B) that\u2019s a frequent user of Twitter.\r\n\r\nIt's as simple as typing in the following: Twitter.com\/USERNAME email\r\n\r\nNOTE: You'll want to replace USERNAME with their actually Twitter handle.\r\n\r\nThen, if the person you\u2019re trying to contact meets these two variables, they likely have revealed their email on Twitter.\r\n<h2>Step 8: Utilize VoilaNorbert<\/h2>\r\n<img class=\"aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/10\/Screen-Shot-2016-01-06-at-11.20.14-AM.png\" alt=\"Screen Shot 2016-01-06 at 11.20.14 AM\" \/>\r\n\r\nOne of the most reliable tools on the market, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.voilanorbert.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">VoilaNorbert<\/a>, has taken email finding to a whole new level. Input the person\u2019s name and the domain, and Norbert will return an address with surprisingly amazing efficiency.\r\n\r\nHowever, you\u2019ll only have a limited number of searches per day without needing to buy credits for more, so if you\u2019re a power user, you may want to upgrade.\r\n<h2>Step 9: Try Facebook \"About\"<\/h2>\r\n<img class=\"aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/10\/facebook-about.png\" alt=\"how to find someones email using facebook\" width=\"1040\" height=\"684\" \/>\r\n\r\nWhen trying to find bloggers\u2019 email addresses, Facebook can be a good route to go. Simply visit their company page and check the \u2018About\u2019 section. Most smaller bloggers have no problem putting their names right into their linked Facebook page. Some other companies may put the email address of their social team, which is a little more relevant to your goal than just a standard <a href=\"mailto:info@site.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">info@site.com<\/a>.\r\n<h2>Step 10: Use <a href=\"mailto:Name@Name.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">@Name.com<\/a><\/h2>\r\nWhen all else fails, let\u2019s face it, when someone has a website that is their full name.com, they will most likely have an email address that reads <a href=\"mailto:name@firstnamelastname.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">name@firstnamelastname.com<\/a>. You can verify this using most of the techniques above!\r\n<h2>Step 11: Social Media Direct Messages as a Backup<\/h2>\r\n\r\nIf none of the above options work, you don't always have to use email. LinkedIn allows you to message people directly, and Twitter and Instagram also have settings that default to open for direct messages.\r\n\r\nMany people are not used to being contacted through these avenues, so they can often be very successful for standing out and reaching people that are otherwise hard to reach.\r\n<h2>Successful Email Hunting<\/h2>\r\nWhile there will always be that webmaster that doesn\u2019t want to reveal their contact information, or for whatever reason, they simply forget to include it on their site, it\u2019s often the hardest to find email that provides the most lucrative rewards \u2013 because it is an email that hasn\u2019t been slammed by every marketer under the sun.\r\n\r\nIf you think your content is a great fit for the site, it\u2019s worth the effort of running the gamut on these tools. Happy hunting."

    "title": "What Is Link Building? A Beginner's Guide",
    "content": "Link building is the process of acquiring hyperlinks from other websites primarily for the purpose of improving SEO on search engine results pages (SERPs). \r\n\r\nDriving organic traffic through link building is a cornerstone of SEO best practices, so it\u2019s no wonder that most major marketing agencies use it as one of their top strategies.\r\n\r\nIn the eyes of content marketers, when you build hyperlinks back to your website, you will almost always improve your presence on SERPs. \r\n\r\nWhen Google took over the search engine game, they created an algorithm that identified the number of links back to every webpage and added value to that metric.\r\n\r\nThis is why link building is the bread and butter for so many content marketing strategies \u2014 if playing Google\u2019s algorithm game of hierarchy gets you rankings and links, then why not?\r\n\r\n<h2> The Definition of Link Building <\/h2>\r\n<strong>Link building<\/strong> is when you gain hyperlinks from other websites that will lead back to you.\r\n\r\nOftentimes, other websites will site you as a resource or pull a quote from your content. When a website or web page has more links attributed to it, Google will see each link as a vote of confidence for your website. \r\n\r\nThe more votes it has, the more likely it is to return higher in the search results, and because these strategies mostly play out in the background, they fall under <a href=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/strategy\/off-page-seo\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">off-page SEO strategies<\/a>.\r\n\r\nWith this in mind, many businesses pursue link building as a way of increasing their votes \u2014 and therefore traffic and sales \u2014 through Google.\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/12\/link-building-flow-chart.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1400\" height=\"1460\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-30200\" \/>\r\n\r\nAt Siege, we once generated more than 5,000 of these links per month for clients like Airbnb, Intuit, Asana, and more.\r\n\r\nIn this guide, we\u2019ll get you started on understanding link building, share the must-have tools, and provide our go-to resources you\u2019ll need to get started. \r\n\r\nOur team has more than 10 years of experience generating hundreds of thousands of links online, so let\u2019s dive in.\r\n\r\n<div class=\"video-container\"><iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/xtJ7F1Q0UYA\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen><\/iframe><\/div>\r\n\r\n<h2>How Does Link Building Work?<\/h2> \r\nAlthough you can get a link from any website online, the most important part is to try to get quality links from high-authority sites that are relevant to your business and branding. \r\n\r\nThere are various methods to qualify the value of the link. \r\n\r\nCommon industry metrics are Page Authority and Domain Authority from <a href=\"\/\/moz.com\/learn\/seo\/domain-authority\u201d\" target=\"\u201d_blank\u201d\" rel=\"noopener\">Moz<\/a>, and URL Rating and Domain Rating from <a href=\"\/\/ahrefs.com\/website-authority-checker\u201d\" target=\"\u201d_blank\u201d\" rel=\"noopener\">Ahrefs<\/a>. \r\n\r\nThese metrics assess the quality and quantity of the links you have to create a score. \r\n\r\nGenerally speaking, the higher these metrics are, the better you\u2019ll rank on Google. In many SEO studies, the correlation is undeniable.\r\n\r\nHere at Siege, we prefer Ahrefs\u2019 SEO metrics as they are continuing to build popularity within the industry, while Moz is on the decline. \r\n\r\nBut don\u2019t get us wrong \u2014 the Moz blog is still a reliable source for SEO, both for off and <a href=\"\/\/siegeproduction.local\/strategy\/on-page-seo\u201d\" target=\"\u201d_blank\u201d\" rel=\"noopener\">on-page SEO<\/a>.\r\n\r\nBut what are these metrics and can you control the way Google and other SERPs recognize your backlink profile? Keep reading to learn more about link building metrics. \r\n\r\n<h2>The Basics of Link Building Metrics<\/h2> \r\nLink building metrics can help you gauge the value of any given piece of content on your website or blog. By using the metrics we stated above from Ahrefs, you can determine if a project needs a revamp or a complete overhaul. \r\n\r\nThese metrics also play a big part in the competitive analysis process and will show you whether a keyword is worth pursuing or not based on both the URL and Domain Rating of your competitors. \r\n\r\nIf you want to check the current link building status of your post, you can also plug your link into Ahrefs\u2019 search bar, and simply click on the \u201cBacklinks\u201d tab at the top of the page. \r\n\r\nHere are more in-depth specifics on Ahrefs\u2019 link building metrics:\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/12\/url-domain-rating.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1400\" height=\"930\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-30202\" \/>\r\n\r\n<h3>URL Rating<\/h3>\r\nURL rating (UR) shows the strength of a backlink profile on a specific webpage. \r\n\r\nThis is a metric from Ahrefs and differs from Moz\u2019s page authority ranking \u2014 which is the analysis of how well the specific webpage will rank against its competitors on SERPs. \r\n\r\n<h3>Domain Rating<\/h3> \r\nDomain rating is an Ahrefs metric that ranks a backlink profile on an entire website. \r\n\r\nWhile it may seem similar to Google\u2019s PageRank algorithm, Ahrefs rates domains based on entire websites, while Google mainly focuses on several individual pages throughout the internet.\r\n\r\n<h2>High-Quality Links Matter<\/h2>\r\nOver time, SEOs started to realize the potential for links as a ranking status and started to generate rankings through the manipulative placement of links on third-party websites \u2014 oftentimes using incentives and giveaways.\r\n\r\nGoogle caught wind of this and found ways to identify these placements, often penalizing the websites through the well-known <a href=\"\/\/www.searchenginejournal.com\/google-algorithm-history\/penguin-update\/\u201d\" target=\"\u201d_blank\u201d\" rel=\"noopener\">Penguin update<\/a>, as well as subsequent iterations of it.\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/12\/ahrefs-graph-2.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1400\" height=\"670\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-30205\" \/>\r\n\r\nAs a webmaster new to link building, our suggestion is to think about generating these links through the quality of your business and your website\u2019s content, but don\u2019t try to manipulate the generation. \r\n\r\nThis often comes back to bite you.\r\n\r\n<h2>The Best Link Building Strategies<\/h2>\r\nAt the core, the <a href=\"\/\/siegeproduction.local\/marketing\/link-building-strategies\u201d\" target=\"\u201d_blank\u201d\" rel=\"noopener\">link building strategies<\/a> we recommend most relate to creating and promoting high-quality content that you host on your website. \r\n\r\nThis ties back to what Google wants to reward on their search engine \u2014 a \u201cvote\u201d for the quality of your website and the backlinks to it. \r\n\r\nMany link builders generate links through off-page strategies that link back to them, but this isn\u2019t truly a mark quality of that website, or the votes that Google casts for your legitimacy.\r\n\r\n<div class=\"video-container\"><iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/pic6zC87fJk?controls=0\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen><\/iframe><\/div>\r\n\r\nThat said, the following are some common link building strategies that content marketers use:\r\n\r\n<h3>Broken Link Building<\/h3>\r\nFirst thing\u2019s first, you need to create a resource on your own website \u2014 whether they be full-length beginners guide, strategies surrounding content marketing and SEO, or something else entirely. \r\n\r\nFor example, Siege Media offers an <a href=\"\/\/siegeproduction.local\/downloads\u201d\" target=\"\u201d_blank\u201d\" rel=\"noopener\">eBook<\/a> that dives deep into our favorite content marketing tips. \r\n\r\nThen, find a website that has a decent URL and domain rating, and check through posts for links that may be broken.\r\n\r\nIf you find a post that could use a new, updated, or unbroken link, reach out to the webmaster, let them know that their link is broken, and provide your resource as a good replacement.\r\n\r\n<h3>Link Reclamation<\/h3>\r\nWe all have Googled ourselves once or twice, right? Well, put that to use for your company. \r\n\r\nSearch for mentions of your company or blog online that don\u2019t include a backlink that leads to your website or resource they mention. Reach out to the webmaster and kindly request a link back to your site.\r\n\r\nIf you have trouble reaching out to webmasters and don\u2019t know what to say, below is a quick template to get you started.\r\n\r\nLink reclamation email template (click below for the PDF):\r\n\r\n<a href=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/12\/what-is-link-building-email-template.pdf\"><img src=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/12\/what-is-link-building-email-template.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1400\" height=\"1438\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-30206\" \/><\/a>\r\n\r\n<h3>Guest Blogging<\/h3>\r\nFor many webmasters, the amount of content they produce is a valuable metric. \r\n\r\nBy providing them with valuable content that sticks out, content marketers generate links back to their websites.\r\n\r\nThat said, it\u2019s important to be careful not to overuse this strategy because <a href=\"\/\/www.searchenginejournal.com\/google-guest-posting-for-links-warning\/372115\/\u201d\" target=\"\u201d_blank\u201d\" rel=\"noopener\">Google may devalue them<\/a>.\r\n\r\nIt\u2019s important that any guest posts you create for your brand have quality written content so you can best represent yourself on other platforms and potentially build your audience.\r\n\r\nUse the following when creating a guest blog post:\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Statistics pieces<\/li> \r\n<li>How-To guides<\/li>\r\n<li>An article that shows your <a href=\"\/\/siegeproduction.local\/seo\/what-is-eat\u201d\" target=\"\u201d_blank\u201d\" rel=\"noopener\">E-A-T<\/a> (expertise, authority, and trustworthiness)<\/li>\r\n<li>Data and case studies<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n\r\n<h3>Internal Linking<\/h3>\r\nThere are two main types of internal links: inbound and outbound. \r\n<ul>\r\n<li><strong>Inbound internal links<\/strong> are links that direct users to your post from a different page on your domain.<\/li> \r\n<li><strong>Outbound internal links<\/strong> are hyperlinks that direct users to a different page on your domain.<\/li> \r\n<\/ul>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/12\/internal-linking.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1400\" height=\"1430\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-30199\" \/>\r\n\r\nInternal linking is important in any content marketing strategy because it helps both the users (and Google) navigate through your website. \r\n\r\nInternal linking matters because:\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>It\u2019s a Google algorithm ranking factor<\/li>\r\n<li>Google uses links to crawl your site<\/li>\r\n<li>It can help users navigate your site with ease<\/li>\r\n<li>It boosts passive link assets and SEO posts<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n\r\nBy linking your own resources throughout your site, you can let your audience research a topic further while staying on your website via the proper anchor text strategy.\r\n\r\nThe best anchor text should be:\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Descriptive<\/li>\r\n<li>Short<\/li>\r\n<li>Easy to spot<\/li>\r\n<li>Specific<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n\r\nThis will also help you gain trust and build authority with both Googlebot and readers alike. \r\n\r\n<h3>Content Promotion With Rich Visuals<\/h3>\r\nIf you already create high-quality content on your website, why not promote it with stunning visuals or blog post imagery?\r\n\r\nBy investing in a design team that will help create brand recognition and authority, you can let your content design do the talking.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, outside websites will be more eager to link to you through curated design assets that catch the eye of an audience.\r\n\r\nRich hero visuals and other <a href=\"\/\/siegeproduction.local\/marketing\/creative-content\u201d\" target=\"\u201d_blank\u201d\" rel=\"noopener\">creative content<\/a> is more captivating than a stock photo and will stand out among other guest blog posts.\r\n\r\n<h3>Digital PR Using Content<\/h3>\r\nSimilar to the above, <a href=\"\/\/siegeproduction.local\/marketing\/what-is-digital-pr\u201d\" target=\"\u201d_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">digital PR<\/a> is a method of promoting your content to a high-traffic site or top-tier news outlets through data studies, breaking news, and other associated content. \r\n\r\nIt\u2019s important to remember who your target audience is and what they\u2019re interested in. \r\n\r\nBy following digital PR best practices, you must recognize that you can\u2019t just throw content out and see what sticks. \r\n\r\nYou need to have intent behind every marketing campaign, and digital Pr is no different.\r\n\r\n<blockquote class=\"definition\">Need help inspiring your next campaign? Check out some of our favorite (and successful) digital PR examples <a href=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/marketing\/digital-pr-examples\" target=\"\u201d_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">here<\/a>.\r\n<\/blockquote>\r\n\r\n<h3>Top-Funnel Content That Ranks<\/h3>\r\nPassive link acquisition is a popular strategy for many content marketers but is often overlooked because it\u2019s a long-term strategy \u2014 usually taking six months to a year. However, the strategy is very valuable in the end.  \r\n\r\nA huge part of how you can build a scannable strategy is by getting top-funnel content that will rank. This, in turn, will generate links and help you build authority. \r\n\r\nBy creating how-to posts and general informative guides on your brand\u2019s website, you can entice the audience into the top funnel of the buyer\u2019s journey. \r\n\r\nThis alone will get their gears turning, eventually diving deeper into medium and bottom-funnel content. \r\n\r\n<h3>Siege Media Enters a New Era<\/h3>\r\nIn June 2022, Siege Media made a declaration about link building: We decided to <a href=\"\/\/siegeproduction.local\/marketing\/manual-link-building\u201d\" target=\"_blank\u201d\" rel=\"noopener\">stop most manual link building<\/a> efforts. \r\n\r\nNow, this may sound contradictory to everything we just talked about, but hear us out. \r\n\r\nLink building, cold emails, and guest blogging isn\u2019t always right for us, based on most of our clients and their needs. \r\n\r\nBy leaning on <a href=\"\/\/siegeproduction.local\/strategy\/kob-analysis\u201d\" target=\"\u201d_blank\u201d\" rel=\"noopener\">KOB analysis<\/a> early in our content strategy, we learned that low-difficulty topics and high-quality passive link strategies generated links and added value to our clients without the need for manual outreach \u2014 therefore increasing our productivity and streamlining our content marketing efforts \u2014 and getting us head-turning results in the process. \r\n\r\n<img src=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/12\/roi-of-manual-vs-passive-link-building.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1400\" height=\"1255\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-30201\" \/>\r\n\r\n<h2>Link Building Resources<\/h2>\r\nThe link building rabbit hole goes much deeper than this beginner\u2019s guide.

Establish Product-Market Fit<\/h2>\r\n\r\nBefore you even consider implementing a new website traffic strategy, you need to establish <a href=\"https:\/\/www.productplan.com\/glossary\/product-market-fit\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">product-market fit<\/a>. \r\n\r\nProduct-market fit refers to the idea that your business's products or services are being bought, used, and praised by your target audience.\r\n\r\nIf you can create a product that satisfies the wants and needs of your audience, you already took a giant step toward growing your traffic and business.\r\n\r\nIf you\u2019re already seeing traction and you have a growing authority in the industry, your traffic will follow. Further, until you\u2019ve created a product or service that satisfies product-market fit, you shouldn\u2019t focus your efforts anywhere else.\r\n\r\n<h2 id=\"kob-analysis\">2. Perform and Use KOB Analysis<\/h2>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"video-container\"><iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/bZe771lsU6c\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen><\/iframe><\/div>\r\n\r\n<a href=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/strategy\/kob-analysis\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">KOB analysis<\/a>, or Keyword Opposition to Benefit Analysis, is the crucial next step to growing your website visits. \r\n\r\nYour KOB analysis considers your revenue potential and ROI in combination with your competition\u2019s. Prioritizing your most beneficial, rankable content first can propel you toward more difficult topics in the future.\r\n\r\nAfter enough time, effort, and subsequent rankings, your website traffic should grow and allow you to focus on other aspects of your business.\r\n\r\n<h3>The KOB Equation for Content<\/h3>\r\nOriginally popularized by Todd Malicoat, KOB analysis has many different forms and levels of complexity. \r\n\r\nFor the purposes of this analysis and your own implementation, we\u2019ll keep it relatively simple.\r\n\r\nTraffic value is the estimated amount of revenue a page earns, and it\u2019s calculated by multiplying the clickthrough rate (CTR) against all its ranking positions. \r\n\r\nFrom there, each tool uses Google AdWords\u2019 CPC to see what others would be willing to pay for that same traffic.\r\n\r\n<strong>We use traffic value here because:<\/strong>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>It is a strong estimate of the real value of a page<\/li>\r\n<li>Helps approximate the monetary value when ranking for a topic<\/li>\r\n<li>Focuses on pages rather than individual keywords<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n\r\nBecause traffic value focuses on page valuation, using the content ranking #1 for your target keyword or topic in your KOB equation is important. \r\n\r\n<img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-27660\" src=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/11\/accounting-calculator-metrics.png\" alt=\"accounting calculator metrics on ahrefs\" width=\"1400\" height=\"673\" \/>\r\n\r\nAdditionally, we need to know the keyword difficulty of our target topic. \r\n\r\nThis score gives us a quick snapshot of the competition on a given keyword set, which allows us to determine how quickly and easily we can rank for a particular topic.\r\n\r\n<strong>We include the difficulty score in our KOB because it:<\/strong>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Implies how competitive a keyword or topic is<\/li>\r\n<li>Alludes to the strength of the competitor\u2019s backlinks<\/li>\r\n<li>Indicates the authority of competitor content<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n\r\nBecause your revenue potential can be offset by the keyword difficulty, these two figures are used in an equation to determine the KOB score for a target keyword or topic set.\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/11\/KOB-score.png\" alt=\"kob equation for content\" width=\"1201\" height=\"399\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-30454\" \/>\r\n\r\nNow that you understand what traffic value and difficulty mean, finding your KOB score takes a few simple steps:\r\n\r\n<ol>\r\n<li><strong>Plug in the necessary data:<\/strong> Popular SEO tools \u2014 such as <a href=\"https:\/\/www.semrush.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Semrush<\/a>, <a href=\"https:\/\/moz.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Moz<\/a>, and <a href=\"https:\/\/ahrefs.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Ahrefs<\/a> \u2014 are great for finding and calculating traffic value and difficulty.<\/li>\r\n<li><strong>Divide traffic value by the difficulty score:<\/strong> This will produce an initial KOB score to help you prioritize keywords and topics.<\/li>\r\n<li><strong>Repeat the process:<\/strong> At Siege Media, our fleshed-out KOB sheets have more than 150 keywords or topics.<\/li>\r\n<\/ol>\r\n\r\n<h3>KOB Analysis Example<\/h3>\r\nTo give an example of this process in action, let\u2019s look at the keyword \u201ccontent marketing.\u201d Using Ahrefs, we get back the following data:\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/11\/keyword-content-marketing.png\" alt=\"search volume and keyword difficulty for content marketing\" width=\"1201\" height=\"336\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-30453\" \/>\r\n\r\nAt the surface level, we can see that this keyword is extremely competitive and has a fairly high monthly search volume. \r\n\r\nBut, if we dive below the surface, we can find other helpful information \u2014 namely, the potential value of each monthly visit and target-worthy longtail keywords.\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/11\/overview-content-marketing.png\" alt=\"ahrefs data of keyword content marketing\" width=\"1201\" height=\"672\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-30455\" \/>\r\n\r\nFirst, enter \u201ccontent marketing\u201d into your preferred search engine and copy the URL of the highest-ranking result that you feel is most similar to the content you hope to create. \r\n\r\nFor this example, we used the \u201cWhat is Content Marketing?\u201d page from the Content Marketing Institute (CMI).\r\n\r\nNext, we input this URL into Ahrefs to analyze the revenue and traffic opportunities available to us. \r\n\r\nIn our case, the estimated traffic to the page is 25,000 visits a month, based on 9,700 keywords. Plus, Ahrefs also calculates the estimated traffic value, which is $280,000 a month for the keyword \u201ccontent marketing.\u201d \r\n\r\n<img src=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/11\/what-is-content-marketing-1.png\" alt=\"estimated traffic value of what is content marketing by cmi\" width=\"1201\" height=\"335\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-30457\" \/>\r\n\r\nTo find our KOB score, we need to divide the traffic value by the keyword difficulty. Out of context, one KOB score means nothing, but additional research and a built-out topic database can help us use this score to prioritize how and when we work specific content into our strategy. \r\n\r\nOnce the initial score is created, you may notice there are topics that have high traffic value, but probably don't have any chance of converting for the client due to lack of authority or relevancy. \r\n\r\n<strong>We solve for this by applying a \u201cRelevancy Score\u201d to the KOB.<\/strong> \r\n\r\nThis multiplies the KOB by the appropriate number.\r\n\r\nIf it\u2019s a great fit, give it a 3.\r\n\r\nIf it\u2019s in the middle, give it a 2.\r\n\r\nIf it\u2019s marginal but still relevant, give it a 1.\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/11\/kob-relevancy-score.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1400\" height=\"541\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-30518\" \/>\r\n\r\nDo keep in mind that your Relevancy Score is effectively an educated guess. That\u2019s okay, as the overall goal here is to improve our directional decision making around monetizable topics \u2014\u00a0not be perfect.\r\n\r\nNow, you can reprioritize your keywords and topics. Clustering together similar ideas or services can decrease the content you need to create while strengthening your strategized content.\r\n\r\nBefore you start creating a project plan, check out our KOB analysis spreadsheet for our ready-to-use document.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/11\/KOB-Keyword-Research_-Siege-Media-Template.xlsx\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-27689\" src=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/11\/02-download-our-kob-cta.png\" alt=\"pdf download of kob analysis template\" width=\"1400\" height=\"550\" \/><\/a>\r\n\r\n<h2 id=\"project-plan\">3. Prepare a Project Plan<\/h2>\r\n\r\nWith your research in hand, it\u2019s time to start thinking about your project plan. \r\n\r\nWhile your KOB analysis is great for finding low-competition, high-benefit keywords, you still need to prioritize target topics and keywords to make sure you\u2019re capitalizing on the content you can rank for. \r\n\r\nAsk yourself these three things when preparing your strategy:\r\n\r\n<ol>\r\n<li>What is your Domain Authority (DA)?<\/li>\r\n<li>What internal resources do you have?<\/li>\r\n<li>Are you creating top-, middle-, or bottom-funnel content?<\/li>\r\n<\/ol>\r\n\r\nFor example, if your DA is lower than 70, your best bet for strong content creation is to prioritize topics or keywords with a difficulty rating lower than 60 or 70. \r\n\r\nOn the flipside, if your domain authority is 70+, your prioritization should consider what you can rank for without promotion.\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/11\/difficulty-and-domain-kob.gif\" alt=\"how to prioritize topics on project plan\" width=\"1920\" height=\"1080\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-30486\" \/>\r\n\r\nUnderstanding the strengths and weaknesses of your own domain will help you determine the content that is best for your business. \r\n\r\nAdditionally, after your project plan is solidified, refer back to your KOB to adjust scope. How long will you need to productively create each piece of content? Add this to your sheet and divide the original KOB score by the estimated hours to finalize your revised KOB score.\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/11\/kob-scope-revised-score.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"600\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-30521\" \/>\r\n\r\nAll in all, investing in your <a href=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/seo\/content-strategy\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">SEO content strategy<\/a> and a team of content creators will allow you to grow and prioritize more projects, invest time and energy into revamping older posts, and create new content that is great the first time around.\r\n\r\n<div class=\"video-container\"><iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/42mBTFKlEjA\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen><\/iframe><\/div>\r\n\r\n<h2 id=\"passive-link-topics\">4. Prioritize Passive Link Topics<\/h2>\r\n\r\nIt\u2019s no secret that Siege Media has sent over 1 million outreach emails. \r\n\r\nWe started as a link generation company, but we\u2019ve slowly <a href=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/marketing\/manual-link-building\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">stopped manual outreach<\/a> for most of our clients. \r\n\r\nWhy? Because by focusing on search-driven topics that emphasize a brand\u2019s services, products, and expertise, we have seen a substantial increase in content performance through passive link building. \r\n\r\n<img src=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/12\/roi-of-manual-vs-passive-link-building.png\" alt=\"roi of manual vs passive link building graph\" width=\"1400\" height=\"1255\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-30201\" \/>\r\n\r\nInstead of allocating double the time and resources to a post that will need manual outreach to rank, we have learned that focusing our talents on creating <a href=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/creation\/seo-friendly-content\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">search-friendly content<\/a> to begin with can bring in hundreds of links to a single post. \r\n\r\nPlus, Google prioritizes branded content, so our focus on shareable and promotable aspects just wasn\u2019t cutting it alone.\r\n\r\nWhile it\u2019s not worth completely throwing manual outreach \u2014 what we call <a href=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/marketing\/what-is-digital-pr\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">digital PR<\/a> at Siege Media \u2014 out the window, you may want to consider reevaluating how your content is gaining links.\r\n\r\nDownscaling your outreach to simply include <a href=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/marketing\/advanced-link-reclamation\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">link reclamation<\/a> and nothing else may seem counterintuitive \u2014 but trust us, search-driven content is just as valuable (if not more valuable) to your website\u2019s traffic as promotable content.\r\n\r\nTake any statistics post, for example. For most of these posts, the people who are searching for a statistic are most likely looking to include it in their own content and link back to the original creator. \r\n\r\nThis is passive link building.\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/11\/example-post.png\" alt=\"mint financial statistics post example\" width=\"1201\" height=\"949\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-30451\" \/>\r\n\r\nThis study about <a href=\"https:\/\/mint.intuit.com\/blog\/planning\/financial-statistics\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">financial statistics<\/a> by Mint has gained more than 150 links simply because it is easy to read, has intriguing visuals, and offers the readers plenty of raw data.\r\n\r\nOther posts with <a href=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/creation\/interactive-content\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">interactive content<\/a> \u2014 like calculators, cost pages, trends, and quizzes or pages \u2014 are high search-driven topics that can gain hundreds of passive links. \r\n\r\nSimilar to service or product offerings, content that prioritizes passive link topics responds to the need and intent behind a search.\r\n\r\nWho wouldn\u2019t want to link to a post that answered an important question or solved a difficult problem?\r\n\r\n<div class=\"video-container\"><iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/mxEzl81jS-4\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen><\/iframe><\/div>\r\n\r\n<h2 id=\"strong-content\">5. Create Strong Content<\/h2>\r\nNow comes the hard part \u2014 actually creating the content (great content that is). \r\n\r\nIt\u2019s a no-brainer that you should always focus on creating good content, but do you know what you need to create content that\u2019s <a href=\"https:\/\/moz.com\/blog\/why-good-unique-content-needs-to-die-whiteboard-friday\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">10x better than the competition<\/a>?\r\n\r\nBeing two or three times better may not be enough for your pieces to rank. \r\n\r\nDon\u2019t bet on your semi-better piece winning the race. Implement simple changes to your <a href=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/creation\/content-creation\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">content creation<\/a> strategy to propel your content from good to great.\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><strong>Short URLs:<\/strong> Your URLs should be simple and identifiable.

Optimize Internal Linking<\/h2>\r\nOptimized <a href=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/seo\/what-is-link-building\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">internal linking<\/a> is important to any content strategy because it helps your visitors \u2014 and search engine crawlers \u2014 navigate your content and site.\r\n\r\nInternal links refer to links within the body of your content that link your post to other pages on your website. There are two types of internal links:\r\n\r\n<ol>\r\n<li><strong>Inbound internal links:<\/strong> Links that guide readers back to your post from a different website page.<\/li>\r\n<li><strong>Outbound internal links:<\/strong> Links that guide readers away from your post to a different website page.<\/li>\r\n<\/ol>\r\n\r\nGiving readers (and Google) internal resources to research a topic further helps boost passive linking assets, keeps readers on your site longer, and determines website hierarchy. \r\n\r\nPlus, internal links are great for spreading link equity.\r\n\r\nKnowing what to link and what not to link can be difficult, especially if you have plenty of content on your website. As a rule of thumb, including between five and ten links per post is a safe bet for optimized internal linking.\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/11\/beware-of-too-many-links-on-articles.png\" alt=\"good versus bad internal linking examples\" width=\"1201\" height=\"842\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-30450\" \/>\r\n\r\nOur best tips to optimize internal linking include:\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Keeping all <strong>content within two clicks of the homepage<\/strong><\/li>\r\n<li>Ensuring your <strong>blog or learning center is in the navigation bar<\/strong> of your website<\/li>\r\n<li>Displaying <strong>15+ posts on your blog homepage<\/strong><\/li>\r\n<li>Linking <strong>sparingly and strategically<\/strong><\/li>\r\n<li>Using <strong>clear anchor text<\/strong><\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/07\/upload-and-publish-your-content.png\" alt=\"do this not that internal linking tips\" width=\"1401\" height=\"901\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-29051\" \/>\r\n\r\n<h2 id=\"update-content\">7. Update Content Annually<\/h2>\r\nAfter you researched, created content, and focused on link building, it\u2019s time to consider your posts\u2019 sustainability. \r\n\r\nThere\u2019s no guarantee that your rankings will hold, even if you\u2019ve gained the #1 spot. \r\n\r\nFluctuation is normal and content becomes outdated, but you can avoid losing all your progress with one simple method: <strong>content updates<\/strong>. \r\n\r\nCreating and publishing a great blog post does not mean you are banned from ever updating it again. In fact, maintenance and refreshes to your content should be strategized concepts in your content marketing mix.\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/07\/update-content-annually.png\" alt=\"traffic increase benefits of content updates via graph\" width=\"1401\" height=\"901\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-29053\" \/>\r\n\r\nIf your posts aren\u2019t delivering updated facts and statistics, your site visitors will get fed up and leave. Annual content updates are a great way to ensure your readers receive the information they need without putting a ton of strain on your project plan or content team.\r\n\r\nWho\u2019s going to click on \u201cContent Marketing Statistics for 2019\u201d when your competition has created a \u201cContent Marketing Statistics for 2023\u201d post?\r\n\r\nWe also suggest keeping an eye on the SERPs for something we call <a href=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/seo\/freshness-distance\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">freshness distance<\/a>, or the distance between the oldest timestamp and the newest one. If you are consistently in the top 25%, there\u2019s a good chance you\u2019ll rank well.\r\n\r\n<div class=\"video-container\"><iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/Q9xzdYpI3eo\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen><\/iframe><\/div>\r\n\r\nKeep track of your content updates with a project tracker. This will help keep your team organized while achieving high-value wins with low effort.\r\n\r\nIf you stick to updating your content at a pace that works for your business, you\u2019ll see great website traffic growth over time. Maybe even a growth of 250,000+ a month, sustainably.\r\n\r\n<h2 id=\"repeat\">8.

    "title": "How Much Does Link Building Cost in 2022?",
    "content": "Link building pricing can vary from $100 to over $1,500 per link, depending on the industry you are in. A common campaign budget is $5,000-$20,000\/mo, often tied to content marketing activity that also has secondary KPis.\r\n\r\nHowever, if you\u2019re Googling something like \u201clink building cost\u201d, you may have come in the door wondering how much you\u2019ll need to pay someone to generate links for you manually. This answer is different, and can often lead you down the wrong path.\r\n\r\nSiege Media is a 110-person SEO-focused content marketing agency that generates thousands of links per month for our clients. Link building is what we do, and as part of that process we actually turn away clients, because they shouldn\u2019t manually be generating them\u2026 or the ROI isn\u2019t there.\r\n\r\nIn this post, we\u2019ll break down why that is, how to know if manual link building is for you, and what to do instead if you find that it isn\u2019t.\r\n<h2>The Value of Links for Your Business<\/h2>\r\n<div class=\"video-container\"><iframe src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/-_s3JrM-6hg\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"><\/iframe><\/div>\r\nManual link building isn\u2019t for every business because the cost of doing it may not be high enough to warrant pursuing it. That doesn\u2019t mean links don\u2019t have value, it\u2019s just that you\u2019ll need to generate them in different ways to be positive ROI.\r\n\r\nThe way we calculate this at Siege is to look at the monthly <a href=\"https:\/\/help.ahrefs.com\/en\/articles\/1012028-what-is-traffic-value-in-site-explorer\">traffic value<\/a> on Ahrefs of the winning website in your vertical, and then divide it by the number of linking root domains it has. This tells us the average monthly value of a link for a website winning most of the traffic.\r\n\r\n<img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-15757\" src=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/10\/4.08-\u2013C2A02.7M-divided-by-1.4K.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"3473\" height=\"457\" \/>\r\n\r\nWe\u2019ll then multiply that number by 24 to create a \u201clifetime link value\u201d... a reasonable duration of time that a link should pass value on the web. Some links fall off the link graph because a website is pulled down, or redesigned, and etc.\r\n\r\nThis number represents a solid number to work off in comparison to how much manual links cost for you to generate. <b>Our suggestion would be to have lifetime link value be close to 10:1 to the cost of generating a manual link <\/b>to account for uncertainty that comes with SEO.\r\n\r\n<img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-15756\" src=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/10\/5.15-\u2013C2A01.8K-multiplied-by-24-month.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"3677\" height=\"486\" \/>\r\n\r\nAs we can see above, CardRatings has a huge value per link. This is pretty rare, and <b>you should expect to see a lifetime link number between $5,000-$15,000 for most businesses<\/b>.\r\n\r\nOn average, the higher the lifetime link number, the harder it is to generate links.\r\n\r\nThis means that<b> if the number is $8,000 and above, it\u2019s almost always a good idea to have some manual link building activity<\/b> as it\u2019s unlikely brand or secondary marketing activities could generate enough links to carry your site on its own.\r\n\r\nIf the number is $5,000 or less, this means you should be generating links organically, or need to be in order to generate positive returns on investment. A counter example of this would be Facebook, who gets linked to so commonly given their brand strength that their lifetime link value is only $52.\r\n\r\n<img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-15758\" src=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/10\/3.04-\u2013C2A01.3B-divided-by-24.7M.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"3450\" height=\"440\" \/>\r\n\r\nIn the middle area, you ideally would have a hybrid strategy where you are generating links manually to your most valuable pages, and also generating <a href=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/marketing\/cost-per-link-analysis\">passive links<\/a> through ranking. You could also be nudging content that generates links naturally higher via manual link building. This mix will often end up with lifetime link values more in the middle range of these metrics.\r\n\r\nTo recap, here are some lifetime link value ranges and expected strategies off each:\r\n<ul>\r\n \t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><b>$7,000+ Lifetime Link Value<\/b>: Manual link building necessary to win.<\/li>\r\n \t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><b>$3,000-$7,000 Lifetime Link Value<\/b>: Link building is important but would ideally be part of a hybrid strategy based on generating links to passive link assets, and manual links to the most important pages on the site.<\/li>\r\n \t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><b>&lt;$3,000 Lifetime Link Value: <\/b>Links should be generated through ranking. Most of the focus should be on increasing link velocity through more and\/or better content.<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n<h2>The Cost of Manual Link Building<\/h2>\r\nSo\u2026 if you know you need manual links, how much should you expect to pay per outcome? As mentioned above, if your lifetime link value skews into the $12,000+ range, I would expect quality links to cost around $800-$1,000+ to generate on average.\r\n\r\nThis is because these numbers occur in verticals where it\u2019s difficult to generate them due to the commercial association with their topics, such as legal, insurance, and credit cards.\r\n\r\nThe further down your lifetime link value, the less you should expect to pay. You\u2019ll often be associated with consumer-friendly verticals in these spaces, and it\u2019ll also be easier to occasionally generate organic links. In verticals with $7,000-$12,000 lifetime link values, you should expect to pay somewhere between $600-$800 on average.\r\n\r\n<img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-27477\" src=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/09\/lifetime-link-value-1.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1400\" height=\"710\" \/>\r\n\r\nAs you get under $7,000 and closer to $4,000 or $3,000, the answer is actually that you shouldn\u2019t be thinking about the cost of a link at all. Links should be a byproduct of other activity (such as SEO-focused content marketing or a <a href=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/marketing\/what-is-digital-pr\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">digital PR strategy<\/a> ), and you should instead be measuring the quality of that activity as an indirect signal of the value of your links.\r\n<h2>What Do Manual Link Vendors Charge?<\/h2>\r\nThere are linkbuilding vendors out there that will charge you for one-off links. These will most often be generated through one of two processes, guest posts or paid links.. and sometimes both.\r\n\r\nThis is really the only way 95% of businesses can generate links unless content is associated with it. This means costs tend to be standardized, and often you\u2019ll end up in the $500-$1,000 range depending on the link authority, topical quality, and etc.\r\n\r\n<img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-27459\" src=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/09\/link-cost.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1401\" height=\"512\" \/>\r\n\r\nWe\u2019re biased at Siege because we generate links through hosted content on-site almost always. We believe in this model because it allows you to generate passive links more often, as well as secondary if not primary KPIs such as direct sales.\r\n\r\nIn our experience, lifetime link value through this model can be as low as $250 <a href=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/marketing\/cost-per-link-analysis\">for just the links<\/a>, and that\u2019s before all the secondary benefits content marketing has.\r\n\r\nAdd in the fact that links tied to content -- generated organically -- are definitely what Google prefers to reward, and you\u2019re all-in hard pressed to warrant going the off-page route when you consider all the facts.\r\n<h2>How to Think About Link Building Cost<\/h2>\r\nTo recap, the cost of link building comes down to the benefit links have for you, and how hard it is to generate links in your specific vertical.\r\n\r\nIf you do the math on lifetime link value, you\u2019ll often find that paying someone $600-$1,000 for a manual link without any other KPIs does not make sense.\r\n\r\nThat\u2019s why you should do that math, or ask someone good at doing it, before pursuing links that may not actually have any real value for you.\r\n\r\nBefuddled by the math?

    "title": "When the Skyscraper Technique Comes Up Short",
    "content": "We\u2019re going on five years since Brian Dean originally popularized the Skyscraper Technique, and since that time, it has received its fair share of controversy and vitriol.\r\n\r\nOn the other side, though, people have also achieved great success and traffic growth utilizing it.\r\n\r\nThe reason behind\u00a0these two diverging modes of thought likely comes down to context, and not necessarily the weakness of the technique. It\u2019s more that the technique isn\u2019t quite as simple as many would describe it: creating better content than content ranking, and then doing outreach to promote it and generate links to it.\r\n\r\nIf the Skyscraper Technique isn't working for your site, don't throw out this incredibly powerful tactic just yet.\r\n\r\nIn this post, I'll break down why the technique\u00a0might not be working for you and what you can do to fix it. But before we do that, let's define the term for those who haven't heard of it.\r\n<h2>What is the Skyscraper Technique?<\/h2>\r\nThe Skyscraper Technique is a term popularized by <a href=\"http:\/\/backlinko.com\/skyscraper-technique\">Brian Dean<\/a> that describes a method of \"building the biggest skyscraper\" or otherwise, biggest and best piece of content as a process of ranking well through Google, and then reaching out to the same people that linked to that other content as a process of generating links.\r\n\r\nHere\u2019s Brian\u2019s TL;DR; three step description from the post:\r\n<ol>\r\n \t<li>Find link-worthy content<\/li>\r\n \t<li>Make something even better<\/li>\r\n \t<li>Reach out to the right people<\/li>\r\n<\/ol>\r\n<h2>How Brian Defines it vs Perception<\/h2>\r\nRe-reading Brian\u2019s definition today, I can\u2019t say that there\u2019s anything off. What\u2019s wrong, then, is how people interpret the definition.\r\n\r\nThe perception problem I encounter most often is with the word \u201cbetter\u201d. The thing is, better is a bit subjective. Some people think better means different things.<strong> Unfortunately, data tells the real story, and some people\u2019s opinion of what's actually better is wrong. <\/strong>\r\n<h2>Better Does Not Equal Bigger<\/h2>\r\nOne of the most common misapplications I see of this technique is that bigger equals better. That is, if they see a result with 25 ideas, they think should list 26. This, in their mind, will give them a clickthrough-rate and content-length advantage that will result in ranking rewards from an engagement perspective.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, it\u2019s rarely this simple, and every topic has a breaking point.\r\n\r\nFor example, let\u2019s look at the topic \u201cAdwords tools\u201d. Our friends at Clickteq made a post\u00a0targeting 102 different tools.\r\n\r\n<img class=\"alignnone wp-image-27450 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/02\/skyscraper-technique-image1.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1400\" height=\"731\" \/>\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, this is the kind of result that has limits, because there are a finite number of actually valuable tools to use. You could list every tool known to man, but you\u2019d actually become less and less valuable with every tool added. That would make the user sort through thousands of different options, putting you further and further away from the optimal result.\r\n\r\n<strong>As it turns out, good curation is not just for social media: it\u2019s for SEO-driven content, too. <\/strong>\r\n\r\nIn this situation, most users want the most effective tools, and they want them handed to them without needing to think. This means getting the opinion in a well-curated package, from an authority they can trust.\r\n\r\nIn mathematical terms, this means this topic is reserved for those who can create something solid and punchy on a high authority, topically relevant\u00a0domain.\r\n\r\nClicteq did a solid job despite the high number, but <a href=\"https:\/\/www.google.com\/search?pws=0&amp;q=adwords+tools\">the results show<\/a>\u00a0that most people would rather get the must-haves handed to them in a smaller, more effective package.\u00a0At the time of this writing there are three blog posts in the top ten, all with 15 or less results.\r\n\r\nAnd not suprisingly, it didn't work and that post no longer exists today.\r\n\r\n<img class=\"alignnone wp-image-27451 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/02\/skyscraper-technique-image2.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1400\" height=\"828\" \/>\r\n\r\nThe hero of our story, Brian Dean, also has a similar post <a href=\"http:\/\/backlinko.com\/seo-tools\">on SEO tools<\/a>. It has a massive number also (177), and he does a good job using interactive filters to allow for \u201cmicro-curation\u201d to quickly match you to what you might be looking for specifically. In addition, he also notes his own authoritative picks.\r\n\r\n<img class=\"alignnone wp-image-27452 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/02\/skyscraper-technique-image3.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1400\" height=\"500\" \/>\r\n\r\nBrian\u2019s ranking pretty well with this post -- surely a lot of it has to do with his high domain authority and 1,200 links at the time of this writing. Despite this, though, posts that likely took 1\/50th the time his post did are <a href=\"https:\/\/www.google.com\/search?sourceid=chrome-psyapi2&amp;ion=1&amp;espv=2&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;q=seo%20tools\">also ranking well<\/a>. Posts with 27, 15 and 45 results respectively, and each with a lot fewer links.\r\n\r\n<img class=\"alignnone wp-image-27453 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/02\/skyscraper-technique-image4.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1400\" height=\"828\" \/>\r\n\r\nLong story short is that I think Brian could have ranked pretty dang well even without doing this, and in many ways may have met the query intent even better. And if you look at many other \"tools\" SERPS, such as <a href=\"https:\/\/www.google.com\/search?pws=0&amp;q=ppc+tools\">this<\/a>, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.google.com\/search?pws=0&amp;q=email+marketing+tools\">this<\/a> or <a href=\"https:\/\/www.google.com\/search?pws=0&amp;q=small+business+accounting+tools\">this<\/a>, you'll see the same story.\r\n\r\n<strong>The answer in this situation is not to create the most amazing tool post ever: it\u2019s likely that you should build domain authority elsewhere and come back to fight another day. <\/strong>\r\n\r\nIt\u2019s not that doing something like Brian did can\u2019t have a lot of success: it did. But even then, with Brian\u2019s industry reputation and 1,200 links, he still isn\u2019t ranking position one. For most, it\u2019s quite likely the marginal benefit of doing something like this does not outweigh other opportunities available.\r\n\r\nOn this topic, and many like it, people want curation. They want quick answers. There\u2019s a threshold area where each content creator must apply discretion.\r\n\r\nThe creator should give people options while also applying expertise, choosing content that\u2019s there not just to add another result, but to actually add value.\r\n\r\n<strong>The people who do the Skyscraper Technique incorrectly add another result because it adds another digit. The people who do it right add another result because it adds value to the post.<\/strong>\r\n<h2>Better Does Not Occur in a Branding Vacuum<\/h2>\r\nThe second most common mistake people make is to assume content is judged simply\u00a0on the basis of its own quality: not who it comes from. To assume this is a fatal flaw in this strategy, and many others like it\u2026 but people keep making it.\r\n\r\n10x content is great, but if searcher satisfaction happens at 1x, you won't beat the big brand who commands the first click. This is one reason we believe very strongly that 2x content performs better than 10x content.\r\n<div class=\"video-container\"><iframe src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/14TE86EqfAw\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"><\/iframe><\/div>\r\nIt\u2019s possible to write an absolutely amazing, A+ post that takes three months on greeting card etiquette that comes from your awesome, well-designed lifestyle blog. But when you\u2019re up against Hallmark\u2019s C+ post, you\u2019ll lose.\r\n\r\nAn average searcher is going to click Hallmark and be satisfied. This means your lack of brand equity will come up short, and you won't\u00a0create a skyscraper. In the eyes of searcher, you'll create\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/www.towerofpisa.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/04\/pisa-leaning-tower1-224x300.jpg\">the Leaning Tower of Pisa<\/a>.\r\n\r\nAnd this isn\u2019t to say the searcher is wrong. Reputation is a qualitative factor that goes into content in the minds of the reader. It just takes years (and sometimes millions) to build it. Unfortunately, no skyscraper will allow you to leap that on certain topics.\r\n<h2>10x Effort != 10x Value<\/h2>\r\n<img class=\"alignnone wp-image-27454 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/02\/skyscraper-technique-image5.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1400\" height=\"1026\" \/>\r\n\r\nAnother problem many fail to realize is that putting 10x effort in does not mean 10x value comes out. For the same reasons users are often satisfied with a mediocre content piece from a brand, not every query deserves the most amazing parallax experience, original photography, high-quality video, or copy written by an acclaimed author.\r\n\r\nOn queries like \u201c<a href=\"https:\/\/www.google.com\/search?pws=0&amp;q=verbose+definition\">verbose definition<\/a>\u201d, you don\u2019t need any of that: you just need a definition and a shred of credibility.\r\n\r\nEven on queries somewhere between that and something worthy of complexity\/elegance in design and UI, like a mortgage calculator, there are gaps where people take the query just a bit further than is really necessary.\r\n\r\nIt is in these gaps that the value created to the end user is negligible. It\u2019s not that a user wouldn\u2019t appreciate or care about a fun animated video defining verbose and walking you through iterations of its use: it\u2019s just that the value difference to the end user is more like 1.01x versus 10x.\r\n\r\nThink of it like a $100 bottle of wine given to someone who has only had a glass or two in their life: they won\u2019t be able to discern a difference in quality no matter how elegantly you worked the grapes, so you would have really been better off serving them a 7-11 alternative versus wasting all that effort and cost in development.\r\n<h2>Linkable Post != Topic Matching Post<\/h2>\r\nThe final and most erroneous, confusing piece of this strategy is when you build something that contains your keyword, generates a ton of links.. but doesn\u2019t match the query.\r\n\r\nAn important thing you should never forget: <strong>the people who link to you in early stages aren\u2019t in the same mindset of those that would be making that search when they actually need it.<\/strong>\r\n\r\nThey might have done that search at some point in their life\u2026 or be generally interested in the subject. That\u2019s possible, and even likely. But they are not in that exact frame of mind when they get your pitch, or read your post through social or email distribution. These are two different psychological states, and they can sometimes result in content that\u2019s highly linkable, but not necessarily topic matching.\r\n\r\nThis often means this content floats around and ranks OK, but never hits the engagement bullseye. It leaves SEOs confounded. The content still likely has benefit for its trickle-in traffic and domain authority boosting awesomeness, but it\u2019s still not a great fit for the topic. It\u2019s doing the concept wrong.\r\n\r\nFor example, this following, old advanced guide to SEO never ranked <a href=\"https:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20180401070511\/https:\/\/www.quicksprout.com\/the-advanced-guide-to-seo\/\">for the term<\/a> it hoped to rank for, [<a href=\"https:\/\/www.google.com\/search?sourceid=chrome-psyapi2&amp;ion=1&amp;espv=2&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;q=seo\">SEO<\/a>].\r\n\r\n<img class=\"alignnone wp-image-27455 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/02\/skyscraper-technique-image6.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1400\" height=\"610\" \/>\r\n\r\nThat's because if you actually look at the search result, you'll see the disconnect. Users want beginners guides, not advanced ones.\r\n\r\n<img class=\"alignnone wp-image-27456 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/02\/skyscraper-technique-image7.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1400\" height=\"644\" \/>\r\n\r\nThat\u2019s not to say the above examples wasn\u2019t valuable for reasons outside of ranking #1. It generated a ton of links, and served as a great resource for QuickSprout.\r\n\r\nHowever, if judged solely on the validity of the Skyscraper Technique, they may be the wrong content to point to. Not every piece of content\u2019s goal is to rank #1, even if it can rank well overall.\r\n<h2>Skyscraper Technique: Yay or Nay?<\/h2>\r\nThe answer is a resounding yay. The technique works, and it\u2019s the foundation of our <a href=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/services\/content-marketing\">content marketing services<\/a>.\r\n\r\nHowever, it doesn\u2019t always map to every piece of content you create.\r\n\r\nSometimes, content strategy means truly matching the topic won\u2019t make sense (try pitching a luxury brand on a roundup post with 50+ results). Yet, it can still have value from a link development\/social\/ancillary traffic perspective, even if it doesn\u2019t dominate the search results.\r\n\r\nAnd sometimes, a consistent and effective blog strategy means it\u2019s just not feasible to do this with frequency.\r\n\r\nWe used this strategy on our own blog in early days: it caused us to rarely post. If your market analysis tells you people want to hear from you daily or even weekly (see: news), you aren\u2019t building many skyscrapers.\r\n\r\nLike the name states: it\u2019s a technique. A valuable technique in any toolkit, but one many can misapply if incorrectly assessed. Think it through, have the self-awareness to know what you can\u2019t rank for, and understand up front when you might not be a great topical fit.\r\n\r\nThose recommendations,\u00a0applied in addition to this technique, can result in the growth Brian and others frequently observe\u00a0with this approach."

Blog Index Should Show 15+ Posts<\/h2>\r\n\r\nIt\u2019s all too common to see blog hubs with an untouched layout. The ease of installing intricate and eye-catching website themes has made SEO fundamentals fall by the wayside, namely blog index areas. \r\n\r\nHowever, this valuable piece of website real estate has an influential impact on the performance of your blog. \r\n\r\nWhether you have a newer or more established website, chances are your older posts get buried as you continue to publish new pieces. This is bad for both your readers and your Google ranking.\r\n\r\nFor your readers, it makes it harder to find what they are looking for. Without a proper blog index page that shows 15 or more posts, they could end up painstakingly clicking through your website just to read a few articles \u2014\u00a0and when that happens, they leave.\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/01\/helpscout-blog-index-15.jpg\" alt=\"Help Scout blog index page screenshot\" width=\"1400\" height=\"1660\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-30891\" \/>\r\n\r\nThis is why it's in your best interest to have a strategic blog index page:\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n     <li><strong>Your website will be easier to crawl:<\/strong> New blog posts need to be indexed before they can rank. One of the most common ways Google does this is by following hyperlinks of previously indexed pages to new ones. So, having an index area on a popular page on your website \u2014 like your blog hub or resource page \u2014 can help Google find your new posts faster.<\/li>\r\n     <li><strong>Your <a href=\"https:\/\/www.selesti.com\/knowledge-hub\/pagination-click-depth-and-seo#:~:text=The%20importance%20of%20click%20depth,-Definition%3A%20Click%20depth&amp;text=Because%20click%20depth%20is%20among,to%20actually%20find%20the%20content.\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">click depth<\/a> will improve:<\/strong> Simply put, having 15 or more posts on your hub page helps reduce your content's crawl depth, which results in more authority across your site in the eyes of Google.<\/li>\r\n     <li><strong>Your content will rank higher:<\/strong> Ultimately, a proper blog index gets more eyes on your content. More attention equals more authority, and more authority equals climbing the SERP.<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n\r\n<h2 id=\"customize-blog-index\">2. Customize Your Blog Index<\/h2>\r\n\r\nCreating a proper blog index is a step in the right direction, but that&rsquo;s only one piece of the puzzle. Another way to stand apart and build website authority is to <a href=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/seo\/blog-best-practices-seo\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">strategically customize your indexing design<\/a> whenever possible.\r\n\r\nA few methods include:\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><strong>Calling out your buyer personas:<\/strong> If your website attracts different buyer personas, make it easier for them to find the most relevant content. Separating index posts with labels such as &ldquo;customer service&rdquo;, &ldquo;marketing&rdquo;, or any other high-level callouts to your individual audiences can increase visibility and boost your user experience.<\/li>\r\n<li><strong>Emphasizing most recent posts<\/strong>: A &ldquo;recently published&rdquo; section will alert your users to fresh articles. Placing this section near the top of your homepage will make your website feel consistently updated and can help with indexing new posts.<\/li>\r\n<li><strong>Separating categorically:<\/strong> Similar to calling out buyer personas, separating articles by category can make the user experience easier and more efficient. By grouping similar articles, readers can easily find what they are looking for and will be more inclined to stick around your website reading blog after blog.<\/li>\r\n<li><strong>Experimenting with hand-picked suggestions: <\/strong>Are there low-performing articles on your website or posts that simply aren&rsquo;t getting enough attention? Or maybe you want to shine a spotlight on high-performing content that drives conversions or other business goals? Solve this situation by placing hand-picked suggestions in each blog post category or indexing section.<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n\r\n<h2 id=\"make-small-updates\">3. Make Small Updates vs. Large Ones<\/h2>\r\n\r\nRather than waiting once a year to update 100% of a post, try to schedule reviews and updates four times a year to chip away at 25% of the post. This is because both Google and searchers look favorably on updated articles.\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/01\/freshness-distance-chart.jpg\" alt=\"Graph displaying the benefits of smaller content updates\" width=\"1400\" height=\"618\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-30870\" \/>\r\n\r\nThere&rsquo;s a term in the SEO world called <a href=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/seo\/freshness-distance\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">freshness distance<\/a>, and this plays a part in how well articles rank on Google. \r\n\r\nIf you take a look at the SERP for a given keyword, you will find that most of the top articles were updated within the last few months &mdash; this is because Google puts more value on up-to-date information.\r\n\r\nJust like the search engine goliath, users also put more value on recent information, even if it\u2019s subconscious. \r\n\r\nImagine you are searching for \u201cbest shoes of 2023\u201d with the intent of buying the latest and greatest pair of shoes. Would you even consider clicking on an article titled \u201cBest Shoes of 2020\u201d?\r\n\r\nMaking incremental and authentic updates four times a year can keep your articles fresh and your Google ranking high.\r\n\r\n<h2 id=\"audit-your-content\">4. Improve Traffic, Audit Your Content<\/h2>\r\n\r\nA common misstep for businesses is to forget about a blog post soon after publication and initial promotion. \r\n\r\nWhether staff is too focused on creating new content or there is simply a lack of SEO knowledge, refreshing previous content tends to get swept under the rug \u2014 don\u2019t make that mistake.\r\n\r\nPerforming <a href=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/seo\/content-audit\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">content audits<\/a> can increase website traffic (even <a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=kzHXinOWI04&amp;ab_channel=SiegeMedia\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">double it<\/a>), improve content marketing strategies, and spruce up low-performing articles. \r\n\r\nYou may think this sounds similar to updates, but audits go deeper than editing relevant stats and figures. Audits can bring attention to articles that need a better SEO strategy, as well as those that need a complete rewrite.\r\n\r\nYou don't need to perform large audits every week, but don\u2019t wait for your content to be completely outdated before going in for an overhaul. \r\n\r\nWe find that it's beneficial to make incremental changes to your posts to keep them fresh and competitive rather than waiting until the last minute. A good rule of thumb is to perform an audit two to four times a year. \r\n\r\n<h2 id=\"small-hero-image-size\">5. Keep Hero Image Size Small<\/h2>\r\n\r\nAbove-the-fold areas \u2014 or, the areas above an article that you see without scrolling down \u2014 are crucial website real estate. Not only does it give readers a first impression of your site, it can be leveraged for load times, site experience, and establishing trust.\r\n\r\nHere\u2019s an example of a good hero image in this post from Annuity.org: \r\n\r\n<img src=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/01\/annuity-screenshot.jpg\" alt=\"Annuity.org blog post example displaying a smaller hero image size\" width=\"1401\" height=\"901\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-30866\" \/>\r\n\r\nNotice how the hero image (in this case, the video) takes up less than a fourth of the screen? This reduces website load times while also giving space for a brief article synopsis, a link to a free quote, and an author bio \u2014 increasing the article's credibility.\r\n\r\nConversely, a hero image that needs a bit of work can be seen in this post from Roadrunnersports.com: \r\n\r\n<img src=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/01\/roadrunner-screenshot.jpg\" alt=\"Road Runner Sports blog post\" width=\"1400\" height=\"1042\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-30875\" \/>\r\n\r\nThis hero image commands the entire screen, leaving no room for any beneficial sections that were found in the Annuity.org article. Additionally, a hero image of this size will result in a slower loading time, hampering user experience in the process. \r\n\r\n<h2 id=\"faster-page-experience\">6. Create a Faster Page Experience<\/h2>\r\n\r\nPages on your website should load in less than three seconds. Anything more than that, and your visitors expect a lethargic and frustrating reading experience. \r\n\r\nOptimizing your website is an important part of technical SEO, as faster load times generally lead to better rankings, engagement, and performance. Besides using a smaller hero image, a few best practices for speeding up your site with <a href=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/strategy\/on-page-seo#speed-links\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">on-page SEO<\/a> include:\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><strong>Removing excess code: <\/strong>Excess code can easily slow down your website &mdash; remove inefficient code lines by hand, or with a tool such as HTMLMinifier.<\/li>\r\n<li><strong>Compressing files: <\/strong>For file sizes, the smaller the better. Use any number of compression software on the market to boost performance in this area.<\/li>\r\n<li><strong>Optimizing images: <\/strong>There are a number of <a href=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/creation\/blog-post-images\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">best practices<\/a> to follow when working with blog post images. Just as with files, images should be as small as possible. Additionally, it&rsquo;s a good rule of thumb to use .PNG files for vector graphics and .JPGs for photography.<\/li>\r\n<li><strong>Lowering page redirects: <\/strong>The more HTTPS requests on a server, the slower your website will operate.&nbsp;<\/li>\r\n<li><strong>Investigating server response time: <\/strong>Take a look at your server performance from time to time, paying particular attention to different pain points that bottleneck your website speed.<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n\r\nWhile these strategies are important to note for most any business, do research into your industry to see if there are any specific SEO guidelines. For example, we have seen a non-technical approach to SEO work well in the case of <a href=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/seo\/fintech\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Fintech<\/a>.\r\n\r\n<h2 id=\"trust-with-readers\">7. Establish Trust With Readers<\/h2>\r\n\r\nA great way to establish trust with your readers by utilizing the Expertise - Authority, and Trust method &mdash; otherwise known as <a href=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/seo\/what-is-eat\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">E-A-T<\/a>.\r\n\r\nGoogle developed this strategy in 2013 and still uses it today to determine how trustworthy and authentic a webpage is. A few ways to take advantage of this is by beefing up author sections above the article and clearly stating expertise in the subject matter.\r\n\r\nA good example of an author snippet following the E-A-T method is in this post from <a href=\"https:\/\/www.healthline.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Healthline<\/a>:\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/01\/healthline-screenshot.jpg\" alt=\"Healthline author bio example\" width=\"1400\" height=\"545\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-30871\" \/>\r\n\r\nNotice how the author's details instantly shows credibility. Before the reader dives into the nutrition article, they already know the piece was written by a registered dietician and medically reviewed by another. \r\n\r\nA second example can be found in this travel blog:\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/01\/expertise-for-non-ymyl-topics.jpg\" alt=\"Displaying credibility and expertise in travel blog example\" width=\"1400\" height=\"820\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-30869\" \/>\r\n\r\nThe author instantly shows their expertise by providing hyperlinks to previous European travel articles. This shows a track record of experience and proves they are a trusted voice. \r\n\r\n<h2 id=\"strong-introductions\">8. Build Strong Introductions<\/h2>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/01\/short-tail-vs-long-tail-keywords.jpg\" alt=\"Blog introductions, APPB formula explanation\" width=\"1400\" height=\"1020\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-30877\" \/>\r\n\r\nIn addition to an author bio above the fold, another way to immediately display credibility to your readers is to use the APPB formula. \r\n\r\nAPPB stands for attention, preview, proof, and credibility, and it&rsquo;s our <a href=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/creation\/what-makes-good-blog-post\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">favorite way of writing introductions<\/a>. Here&rsquo;s the summary of what you should look for in each aspect:\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><strong>Attention:<\/strong> Grab the reader&rsquo;s attention immediately. Do this with a shocking statistic, thought-provoking question, or anything else that can deeply resonate with your buyer persona.<\/li>\r\n<li><strong>Preview:<\/strong> Give a teaser of what&rsquo;s to come &mdash; something that lets the reader know they are in the right place.<\/li>\r\n<li><strong>Proof:<\/strong> Share something credible that makes you a trustworthy source. This can be in the form of personal or business achievements, statistics, or the author bio above the fold.<\/li>\r\n<li><strong>Benefit: <\/strong>Tell the reader why they should continue the article. What information does your post have that makes it worth their time?<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n\r\nA good example of this in action is Brain Dean\u2019s article on how to become an SEO expert: \r\n\r\n<img src=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/01\/backlinko-screenshot.jpg\" alt=\"Screenshot of Backlinko blog post showing introduction best practices\" width=\"1400\" height=\"1250\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-30868\" \/>\r\n\r\nAs you can see, he gives a preview of what\u2019s to come in the first paragraph, gives proof by writing about his achievements and why the reader should listen to him, and gives a benefit to the reader: \u201cIf you want to go from SEO rookie to SEO pro\u2026\u201d\r\n\r\n<h2 id=\"kob-analysis\">9. Leverage a KOB Analysis<\/h2>\r\n\r\nKOB Analysis &mdash; or, <a href=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/strategy\/kob-analysis\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Keyword Opposition To Benefit Analysis<\/a> &mdash; should be a mandatory step in every website&rsquo;s content strategy.\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/01\/kob-analysis-strategy-screenshot.jpg\" alt=\"KOB analysis spreadsheet example\" width=\"1400\" height=\"378\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-30874\" \/>\r\n\r\nBy combining variables like keyword difficulty, potential traffic value, and project scope, businesses can gain statistical guidance on which topics to go after and in what order. Doing so can maximize success and profitability.\r\n\r\nFor smaller businesses, a KOB strategy means their websites can rank faster for realistic keywords. By focusing on the easy wins first, smaller operations can build up their Google rank and earn the money they need to continue their SEO strategy. \r\n\r\nFor larger businesses, a KOB strategy means they can focus on the most efficient keywords. \r\n\r\nSince they don\u2019t need to worry about short-term profits the way small businesses do, they can focus on high-value keywords and complete those articles and assets in the most effective way possible.\r\n\r\nA few key aspects of KOB analysis are:\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><strong>Doing research on similar businesses: <\/strong>While you don&rsquo;t want to copy competitors, do some research as to what they are writing about and what keywords they are ranking for. This can give you a good starting point.<\/li>\r\n<li><strong>Compiling keyword data: <\/strong>Once you have established similar businesses, research on Ahrefs or a similar keyword tool to find all of the necessary keyword data in your industry. Pay special attention to variables such as keyword difficulty and traffic value.<\/li>\r\n<li><strong>Keeping a spreadsheet: <\/strong>Arguably the most important part of KOB analysis &mdash; keep a detailed spreadsheet of keyword information. This will serve as the playbook from which you can see which keywords could be the most profitable, and which could take the most or least amount of time to rank.<\/li>\r\n<li><strong>Spending more time than you think: <\/strong>Every industry is different, but we recommend spending 20-40 hours on KOB analysis. This makes sure you are getting a detailed view of industry keywords and will serve as your content calendar for the next few months.<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n\r\nNo matter what stage your business is in, utilizing KOB can be the bedrock upon which your SEO strategy and content thrive. \r\n\r\n<a href=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/11\/KOB-Keyword-Research_-Siege-Media-Template.xlsx\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-27689\" src=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/11\/02-download-our-kob-cta.png\" alt=\"pdf download of kob analysis template\" width=\"1400\" height=\"550\" \/><\/a>\r\n\r\n<h2 id=\"passive-link-opportunities\">10. Passive Link Opportunities<\/h2>\r\n\r\nGenerating content that builds links passively is a great way to have your content work for you at scale &mdash; just <a href=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/marketing\/manual-link-building\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">ask us here at Siege<\/a>.\r\n\r\nIn the early stages of our company, we focused primarily on link generation for our clients: Manual outreach and promotion accounted for hundreds of billable hours per month. \r\n\r\nOver the years, we developed more search-driven content and found that these articles vastly outperformed those that required manual outreach. \r\n\r\nIt was clear to us just how valuable passive links can be for a content strategy.\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/01\/roi-of-manual-vs-passive-link-building.jpg\" alt=\"ROI of manual vs. passive link building graph\" width=\"1400\" height=\"1254\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-30876\" \/>\r\n\r\nThe main differentiating factor is that passive link posts do what the name suggests \u2014 generate links over time without the need for manual outreach. When businesses focus on creating valuable content for their readers, backlinks tend to come naturally.\r\n\r\nExamples of successful passive link post types include:<\/p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Statistics Posts<\/li>\r\n<li>Industry Trends<\/li>\r\n<li>&ldquo;What is&rdquo; topics<\/li>\r\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/creation\/interactive-content\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Interactive content<\/a><\/li>\r\n<li>Any post where users might be looking to grab one data point<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n\r\nA perfect example of passive link building in action is this article from a startup mortgage lender, which grew its organic monthly traffic by <a href=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/strategy\/content-marketing-for-startups\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">458% in 12 months<\/a>:\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/01\/homebuyer-screenshot.jpg\" alt=\"Screenshot of Homebuyer blog post, example of strong passive link content\" width=\"1400\" height=\"1448\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-30873\" \/>\r\n\r\nThis article targets the keyword \u201cWhat is the cheapest type of house to build\u201d \u2014 a \u201cwhat is\u201d topic \u2014 and ranks on Page One on Google for this search term, generating over $5k a month in traffic value. \r\n\r\nSwitching to a passive link strategy can drastically increase your website traffic and the overall quality of your content, and we are living proof of that here at Siege.\r\n\r\n<h2 id=\"add-internal-data\">11. Add Internal Data to Statistics Posts<\/h2>\r\n\r\nThere\u2019s a tendency to use only third-party statistics in data posts \u2014 that\u2019s a missed opportunity for passive backlinks. Whether you know it or not, your business has some type of data research that you can bring to the table, and the time is now to harness that.\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/01\/siege-blogging-statistics-screenshot.jpg\" alt=\"Screenshot of top blogging statistics by Siege Media\" width=\"1400\" height=\"1340\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-30878\" \/>\r\n\r\nYou can see how we utilize this strategy here at Siege in an article we wrote about <a href=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/strategy\/content-marketing-statistics\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">content marketing statistics<\/a>. \r\n\r\nNotice how we included sources from multiple outlets but included our proprietary research at the top &mdash; this is because if you put your internal data high, people have a tendency to reference that data first, creating an incredible opportunity for backlinks.\r\n\r\nDeveloping and publishing studies on your business or industry can be a passive link engine that fuels traffic to your website. \r\n\r\n<h2 id=\"dont-let-people-steal-data\">12. Don\u2019t Let People Steal Your Data<\/h2>\r\n\r\nOnce you created internal data and any other unique asset, make sure you are searching for those terms on Google from time to time. Unfortunately, you may be surprised as to how many websites use that data without properly linking back to your website.\r\n\r\nIf you find your data on another website, kindly reach out to them asking for proper sourcing.\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/01\/typical-link-reclamation-outreach-email.jpg\" alt=\"Link reclamation outreach template for email\" width=\"1400\" height=\"1382\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-30883\" \/>\r\n\r\nFollowing this tip can drastically improve the backlinks on your articles, and makes sure your data is properly sourced and accredited to your business. \r\n\r\n<h2 id=\"high-impact-changes\">13. Focus On High-Impact Changes<\/h2>\r\n\r\nGenerally, ticking boxes off of an audit won\u2019t yield you the fast, impactful results you\u2019re looking for. Rather, spend time focusing on high-impact changes that will yield the biggest benefit for your SEO.\r\n\r\nBut what changes are considered &ldquo;high-impact&rdquo;? Well, we consider these to be the SEO methods that can make the biggest difference for your traffic. Some of these include:\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><strong>UX assessments:<\/strong> Put yourself in the shoes of your website visitors. Is the website design useful or distracting? Is the content scannable? Is the site easy to navigate? Focusing on UX can lead to your visitors sticking around longer.<\/li>\r\n<li><strong>Content audits: <\/strong>Perform periodic content audits to spruce up your archives and find ways to improve upon or update articles. Doing so can drastically increase website traffic.<\/li>\r\n<li><strong>Internal linking analyses: <\/strong><a href=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/seo\/what-is-link-building\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Internal linking<\/a> is an important SEO strategy to improve your Google ranking and UX. Performing a sitewide analysis can result in an improved linking structure, boosting passive links and traffic.&nbsp;<\/li>\r\n<li><strong>KOB implementation: <\/strong>As we mentioned above, if your business is not utilizing KOB analysis, you should do so immediately. This method is a compass that guides your website to an efficient and profitable posting schedule.<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n\r\nAll of these and more can make a tangible difference for your website, and while focusing on small technical fixes such as cleaning up broken links is important, spending the bulk of your effort on high-impact changes will prove to be the most efficient use of your efforts.\r\n\r\n<h2 id=\"audience-first-strategy\">14. Apply an Audience-First Strategy<\/h2>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/01\/audience-research-question-checklist.jpg\" alt=\"Checklist for audience research best practices\" width=\"1400\" height=\"965\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-30867\" \/>\r\n\r\nIt\u2019s likely that your competitors are using a similar approach as you: going to a popular SEO tool, doing keyword research, and exporting a long list of keywords to target. Instead, differentiate yourself by taking an audience-first approach to content strategy.\r\n\r\nRather than using the common keyword research strategy above, write down a list of keyword ideas based on your buyer persona \u2014 not keyword data. \r\n\r\nFocus on topics like their age group, income bracket, pain points, what they love, and a host of other questions to give yourself a better understanding of what they could be searching for. Then, use this to guide your keyword research.\r\n\r\nA few additional audience-first keyword ideas include:<\/p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>[Keyword] costs<\/li>\r\n<li>Industry jargon terms<\/li>\r\n<li>[You] vs. [competitor]<\/li>\r\n<li>[Competitor] alternatives<\/li>\r\n<li>Cost of [product]<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n\r\nDoing this exercise may produce keywords that don&rsquo;t have a high search volume, but have a high search intent that will be sure to resonate with your buyer persona.\r\n\r\n<h2 id=\"brave-title-tags\">15. Use B.R.A.V.E. For Title Tags<\/h2>\r\n\r\nThe <a href=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/seo\/title-tags\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">B.R.A.V.E<\/a><span style=\"color: #0000ff;\">.<\/span> formula can help set up your title tags for success. Here is a simple breakdown of the acronym:\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><strong>Brand<\/strong>: Add when brand recognition is likely to gain you clicks.<\/li>\r\n<li><strong>Recentness<\/strong>: Tell readers how recently your post was published.<\/li>\r\n<li><strong>Amount<\/strong>: How many points you cover in your post vs your competitors.&nbsp;<\/li>\r\n<li><strong>Velocity<\/strong>: How much time you&rsquo;re saving your readers.<\/li>\r\n<li><strong>Economy<\/strong>: Are you a low-price option? Say so!<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n\r\n<h3>Brand<\/h3>\r\nAdd your brand name to the end of your title tag, but don\u2019t modify it for your post. For example, \u201cTITLE TAG - BRAND\u201d is preferable to \u201cTITLE TAG - BRAND <strong>Blog<\/strong>\u201d. Your brand name works best as a point of recognition.\r\n\r\n<h3>Recentness<\/h3>\r\nUpdating your posts regularly will signal that your post is up-to-date with current information \u2014 particularly if you\u2019re clearly displaying your publish date or last modified date. \r\n\r\nTo ensure your updates are valuable, Google will check if you changed the date just to game the system without changing content.\r\n\r\n<h3>Amount<\/h3>\r\nIf your competitors are highlighting &ldquo;the best 10 printers to buy this year,&rdquo; see if you can review 11 printers to stay competitive. Don&rsquo;t overdo it &mdash; there&rsquo;s no need to review 50 printers which can intimidate readers with an unreasonable amount of information. \r\n\r\nAlso, it&rsquo;s important to remember that <a href=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/creation\/content-curation\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">posts with odd numbers<\/a>are clicked more oftenthan posts with even numbers.\r\n\r\n<h3>Velocity<\/h3>\r\nVelocity can be interpreted in a number of different ways. While recentness and velocity may seem to have some overlap, providing helpful tips, shortcuts, templates, or a quick how-to video can bring your users valuable information faster. \r\n\r\nThink of velocity as how much time you\u2019re saving your website visitors.\r\n\r\n<h3>Economy<\/h3>\r\nAre you a price leader or highly competitive in this area? Consider the economic approach to your title tag to tell your customers how much they might be saving.\r\n\r\n<h2>Let\u2019s Get Started<\/h2>\r\nImproving your SEO can be seen as an open-ended process, so we find having clear tips and great direction can be the best place to start if you find you&rsquo;re spinning your wheels. \r\n\r\nWe&rsquo;d love to hear your SEO tips and strategies, and if you need help crafting them, check out our <a href=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/services\/seo\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">SEO consulting services<\/a> to learn more today."

    "content": "If you want to create better, more effective infographics, this post is for you.\r\n\r\nYou probably clicked this article, not because you like looking at the best infographics, but rather, because you want to make them yourself... and you want those that you make, or those that are made for you, to be better.\r\n\r\nHowever, one\u00a0statistic stood out to us: 66%\u00a0of marketers <a href=\"https:\/\/venngage.com\/blog\/visual-content-marketing-statistics\/\">report<\/a> that creating well-designed and engaging visual content is a huge struggle.\r\n\r\nSo, we instructed our team to start bookmarking those examples of great infographics that we really liked. We passed them around the team. We pinned. We shared. We curated.\r\n\r\nEventually, we realized we had a repository of great content. Examples across spectrums, across industries, and across infographic types. A repository of amazing infographics that could help inspire our future pieces, train new hires, and keep our team innovating.\r\n\r\nThat's when we realized we needed to take it to another level, to really curate the best of the best, not just to help others, but to help ourselves. So we sought out to curate a list of 100 diversified, amazing infographics.\r\n<h2>How We Picked the Top <span class=\"numbers\">100<\/span><\/h2>\r\nThis post is the result of 20+ years of experience designing, creating and sharing visual assets. We started with that experience and jotted down every great infographic we could think of, giving us more than\u00a0300 pieces.\r\n\r\nThen I spent an additional few days scouring the internet, grabbing the best of the best from infographic lists, and asking the opinions of experts I respected.\r\n\r\nTo make sure we didn't leave any rocks uncovered, we read through every infographic detailed in the Best Infographics books, and included or annotated any we had listed that came from them, with the knowledge that they would be great sources for a post like this.\r\n\r\n<img class=\"wp-image-11746 size-full aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/01\/photo1-1.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"706\" height=\"424\" \/>\r\n\r\nAt that point,\u00a0I\u00a0chopped down from there. I removed any infographics that didn't blow me away, or otherwise, followed design or idea frameworks\u00a0that other infographics on the list also utilized.\r\n\r\nThis gave us a list of 100 infographic examples that were not just great on their own, but also worked\u00a0great as a collection - thereby making the list stronger overall.\r\n\r\nEach infographic on the list is annotated with an icon that allows you to subsegment by the types that interest you the most. We plan to keep this list updated, too, so check back for updates or otherwise, feel free to suggest infographics worthy of inclusion.\r\n<h2>What the Infographic Icons Mean<\/h2>\r\n<img class=\"wp-image-11747 size-full aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/01\/legend-1.png\" alt=\"legend for infographic icons\" width=\"706\" height=\"396\" \/>\r\n<h2>The <span class=\"numbers\">100<\/span> Best Infographics<\/h2>\r\n[sm_bestinfographics]\r\n<h2>The Best Infographics? Those Tied to Business Outcomes<\/h2>\r\nAt Siege, we're passionate about the fact that infographics should not just be things that are pretty to look at and share. They should also be effective in driving business outcomes. Studies have shown that many infographics are bad at driving brand recall, which isn't great no matter how resonate the concept is. Many of the above infographics likely fall into that (unfortunate) bucket.\r\n\r\nThis said, infographics can be valuable for driving links in addition to brand value. At Siege, we combine both elements to drive top-funnel search volume and also, bottom-funnel rankings.

Sounds strange, right? Let me explain.\r\n\r\nWhile I was toiling away at my first few jobs, I realized there was great long-term value in building up my personal brand (even though I hated that term), as well as my own expertise.\r\n\r\nSo, almost every single night and weekend, I hunted down great marketing content and shared the best-of-the-best on Twitter.\r\n\r\nAnd I kept doing that. Day after day. Month after month. And guess what happened? <strong>Growth<\/strong>.\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/12\/followers.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1401\" height=\"866\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-30008\" \/>\r\n\r\nSharing content helped me form relationships with influential people, helped grow <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/rosshudgens\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">my following on Twitter<\/a>, and ultimately got more people consuming the content I was creating.\r\n\r\nThrough that, I received job offers, column opportunities, and speaking gigs that led to referrals and freelance clients \u2014 all of which culminated in starting my own company. \r\n\r\nToday, we\u2019re a marketing agency with over 100 people and we help some of the biggest brands in the world <a href=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/work\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">grow their online presence<\/a>. \r\n\r\n<strong>That wouldn\u2019t have happened without curation<\/strong>.

This could look like: \r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Tweeting outside news articles relevant to your brand<\/li>\r\n<li>Sharing industry trends in an email newsletter<\/li>\r\n<li>Creating a roundup article with quotes from industry experts<\/li>\r\n<li>Sharing relevant social media posts with your audience<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n\r\nContent curation is more than just sharing outside information, though. \r\n\r\nWhen done right, content curation <strong>adds value<\/strong> by presenting information or context the reader had not otherwise known \u2014 or sharing in a way that makes it easier or more enjoyable to consume. \r\n\r\n<h2 id=\"why-use\">Why Use Content Curation?<\/h2>  \r\nBesides the benefits of building relationships through sharing, I originally sought out curation because I knew the difficulties of <a href=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/creation\/content-creation\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">creating content that\u2019s unique and high-quality<\/a>.\r\n\r\nAt scale, it\u2019s almost impossible to do it repeatedly and at high volume without the \u201chigh-quality\u201d part suffering \u2014 especially since blogs are <a href=\"https:\/\/www.orbitmedia.com\/blog\/blogging-statistics\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">getting longer and more time-consuming<\/a> to write nearly every year. \r\n\r\n<img src=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/12\/average-blog-post-length.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1401\" height=\"795\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-30010\" \/>\r\n\r\nContent curation offers an alternative \u2014 a way to create content that\u2019s effective and easier to do. \r\n\r\n<blockquote class=\"definition\">\r\nIn fact, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.orbitmedia.com\/blog\/blogging-statistics\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">nearly a quarter<\/a> of bloggers make roundups a part of their strategy, and about 41% share news and trends. \r\n<\/blockquote>\r\n\r\nStill, while marketers find it important \u2014 and generally easier to execute than content from scratch \u2014 properly executing content curation can be difficult. Finding the right content to share (that others aren\u2019t already sharing) is a challenging problem.\r\n\r\nThis guide will help solve that problem.\r\n<h2 id=\"content-curation-tips\">5 Tips for Effective Content Curation<\/h2> \r\nNow that you know why content curation is important, let\u2019s get to the how. \r\n\r\nFrom social media content curation to roundup posts, these tips will help you create a winning curation strategy. \r\n\r\n<ol>\r\n<li><a href=\"#unseen-articles\">Share Unseen Articles<\/a><\/li>\r\n<li><a href=\"#add-value\">Add Value to the Sourced Content<\/a><\/li> \r\n<li><a href=\"#impress-creators\">Impress Original Creators<\/a><\/li>\r\n<li><a href=\"#readable\">Make It Readable<\/a><\/li> \r\n<li><a href=\"#ethical-practices\">Use Content Curation Ethical Best Practices<\/a><\/li>  \r\n<\/ol>\r\n<h3 id=\"unseen-articles\">1. Share Unseen Articles<\/h3>\r\nOne of the biggest challenges to content curation is sharing something new. \r\n\r\nCompanies like <a href=\"https:\/\/blog.hubspot.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Hubspot<\/a> and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.moz.com\/blog\/\">Moz<\/a> will see heavy content sharing. Remember that inbound article you wanted to share? Your followers have probably already seen it. \r\n\r\nInstead, try frequenting locations that are only abstractly relevant \u2014 that is, that share content that may only be strongly relevant to your audience 10-20% of the time. \r\n\r\nWhile this type of content may not always be relevant, when it is, it resonates because it\u2019s fresh, new, and otherwise unseen by those in your space \u2014 mainly because they aren\u2019t as willing to dig to find content in the less-obvious 10-20% locations.\r\n\r\nWhile it\u2019s not the most direct application of <a href=\"https:\/\/asana.com\/resources\/pareto-principle-80-20-rule\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Pareto Principle concept<\/a>, it is true that these 20% locations will drive nearly 80% of your results \u2013 sometimes more. \r\n\r\n<img src=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/12\/relevancy-to-results.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1401\" height=\"885\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-30012\" \/>\r\n\r\nExamples of 10-20% content locations for me, and why:\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/news.ycombinator.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Hacker News<\/a>: Mostly targeted at startup founders, employees, and engineers, Hacker News will still surface relevant content or SEO-driven news from time to time.<\/li>\r\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/www.producthunt.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Product Hunt<\/a>: An intuitive resource to find new and interesting tools, some of which may apply to our industry.<\/li>\r\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/dataisbeautiful\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Reddit\/r\/dataisbeautiful\/<\/a> and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/internetisbeautiful\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">\/r\/internetisbeautiful\/<\/a>: Great places to find content inspiration.<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n<h3 id=\"add-value\">2. Add Value to the Sourced Content<\/h3>\r\nSimply tweeting an article by pressing \u201cTweet\u201d is not adding value. Simply reposting an infographic is not adding value. \r\n\r\nGreat curation makes the content better \u2014 either by highlighting it in a new way, or adding a new and <a href=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/marketing\/creative-content\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">creative element to the content<\/a> to make it more interesting or sharable.\r\n\r\nHow can you add unique value?\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><strong>Increase Visibility With Marketing:<\/strong> Many <a href=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/creation\/content-creator\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">content creators<\/a> have great content but miss some marketing fundamentals that curators can improve upon when sharing. For example, creating a more engaging title, sharing at optimal times, or restructuring a post to be more scannable are all great ways to add value.<\/li> \r\n<li><strong>Add Value With Unique Commentary:<\/strong> Along the same vein, adding your unique thoughts when sharing content helps create a larger conversation. As a general rule, delete any of the default text that \u201cShare\u201d buttons give you, and then rewrite it with your own brand voice.<\/li> \r\n<li><strong>Improve the Content With Design\/Development:<\/strong> The surest-fire way to add value is by adding or improving design elements when you curate content. Adding images or videos can increase engagement and, in turn, spur others to share your post.<\/li>    \r\n<\/ul>\r\n<h3 id=\"impress-creators\">3. Impress Original Creators<\/h3>\r\nAn optimal piece of curative content not only adds value on its own, but also builds a deeper relationship with the source creator. \r\n\r\nBy impressing the original creator, you can improve the likelihood they will share your content with their audience \u2014 or they may even follow you\/your brand, improving your content distribution long term. \r\n\r\nIf they\u2019re not impressed, and your roundup post follows a formulaic approach that they\u2019ve seen over and over again, you\u2019ll likely gain little to no benefit from the effort. \r\n\r\nSo, how do we impress influencers with curated content?\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><strong>Make Sure They Are Notified:<\/strong> It should be a no-brainer, but it\u2019s often forgotten \u2014 you will receive no benefit of a deepened relationship if the creator never finds your content. You can do this either through email or on the network where you share the content \u2014 but it definitely needs to be done.<\/li>\r\n<li><strong>Show the Creator Significant Traffic:<\/strong> If you create a roundup post that ranks and sends traffic in perpetuity, or your Tweet gets 20 retweets, there\u2019s a more than solid chance you\u2019ll have an ally for life.<\/li>\r\n<li><strong>Add a Unique, Impressive Take on Their Content:<\/strong> If you share their content with the exact same text the share buttons offer, or put it in \u201clinks of the week\u201d Friday post with nothing else of interest, they probably won\u2019t register your business. But, if you put their content in an <a href=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/creation\/interactive-content\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">interactive piece<\/a> that ranks, they\u2019re likely to take notice.<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n<h3 id=\"readable\">4. Make It Readable<\/h3>\r\nIf your curative content is longer, make sure that it\u2019s easy to read and scan through. \r\n\r\nIn an optimal world, people could enjoy your <a href=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/seo\/post-structure-for-seo\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">post\u2019s structure<\/a> without reading a word of plainly formatted text. You can accomplish this through high-quality photos and great placement of subheaders, bullets, and usage of bold to highlight standout takeaways.\r\n\r\nBeyond making it readable, what are the best practices behind optimal readability?\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Smashing Magazine recommends <a href=\"http:\/\/www.smashingmagazine.com\/2011\/10\/16-pixels-body-copy-anything-less-costly-mistake\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">16px font for body copy<\/a>.

If a column width is too wide, it\u2019s difficult to track back to the next line \u2014 if it\u2019s too short, it\u2019s difficult for a reader to establish a rhythm.<\/li>\r\n<li>Write your copy for <a href=\"http:\/\/www.cision.com\/us\/2015\/02\/11-tips-to-improve-your-copys-readability\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">seventh-grade readers<\/a>.

Use Content Curation Ethical Best Practices<\/h3>\r\nLast but definitely not least, make sure you are sharing curated content ethically. It\u2019s unfortunate, but <strong>not everyone will want their content curated.<\/strong>\r\n\r\nFor example, when rounding up content around recipes, many bloggers do not see the value of another link. \r\n\r\nThey don\u2019t want others to use their photographs without compensation and, therefore, will be extremely upset if you use their content on a business site that may profit from them.\r\n\r\nFor that reason, if you are using someone\u2019s photography, or anything else that took a significant amount of time to create or possibly could be sold for profit, you should email to ask permission before posting unless there is an explicit statement permissing it on their website.\r\n\r\nIn addition, you should always follow the following rules:\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><strong>Link to the source content.<\/strong> A no-brainer, but some people will post others' content without linking to the source.<\/li>\r\n<li><strong>You should not steal traffic, you should push traffic.<\/strong> For example, if posting a recipe, you should post a photo and a link to it \u2014 not the recipe in full. If you posted the recipe in full, you\u2019re basically stealing the traffic.<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n\r\n<h2 id=\"content-curation-examples\">5 Content Curation Examples<\/h2>  \r\nWant some examples of businesses doing this strategy right? \r\n\r\nCheck out the following lists \u2014 they can be good not just for inspiration, but also for finding content to share as well.\r\n<h3>1. Siege Media<\/h3>  \r\n\r\nLet\u2019s start by tooting our own horn. \r\n\r\n<img src=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/12\/siege.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1401\" height=\"656\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-30029\" \/>\r\n\r\nIn this roundup post on the Siege Media blog, we highlight some of the best <a href=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/marketing\/creative-content\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">creative content marketing ideas<\/a> across the web by linking out to excellent blogs, animations, videos, interactives, and more. \r\n\r\nEach section includes a bulleted list of advice to content marketers looking to implement these ideas \u2014 which is a great value-add. \r\n\r\nCheck out some of our other roundup posts to see how we use curative content to create robust, useful articles. \r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/creation\/interactive-content\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">What Is Interactive Content? 12 Examples Worth the Effort<\/a><\/li>\r\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/strategy\/business-blog-examples\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">14 Business Blog Examples and Why They Work<\/a><\/li> \r\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/strategy\/content-marketing-examples\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">14 Memorable Content Marketing Examples That Made an Impact<\/a><\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n\r\n<h3>2. Marketing Brew<\/h3> \r\n\r\n<img src=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/12\/marketing-brew-1.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1401\" height=\"1151\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-30024\" \/>\r\n\r\n<a href=\"https:\/\/www.marketingbrew.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Marketing Brew<\/a> is one of several newsletters that Morning Brew offers. \r\n\r\nNot only does Morning Brew know their audience by curating content based on verticals like marketing, social media, and crypto, but they also make catching up on the latest news quick and easy. \r\n\r\nTheir simple summaries paired with links to original sources mean readers can get either the quick update or in-depth read they desire. \r\n\r\n<h3>3. Next Draft<\/h3>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/12\/next-draft-1.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1401\" height=\"1579\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-30025\" \/>\r\n\r\nEvery day, Dave Pell visits 75 news sites and chooses the best ten stories from the pack for his <a href=\"http:\/\/www.nextdraft.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">NextDraft<\/a> newsletter. \r\n\r\nDoes curation get better than that? \r\n\r\nWell, yes \u2014 Dave also adds insightful commentary to the ten stories that makes his newsletter a must-subscribe. \r\n\r\n<h3>4. Further<\/h3>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/12\/further.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1401\" height=\"826\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-30022\" \/>\r\n\r\nCurated by CopyBlogger founder Brian Clark, <a href=\"https:\/\/further.net\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Further<\/a> does an elegant job of not only bringing together great resources, but also presenting them in a minimalistic, beautiful fashion. This artistic look helps Further stand out amongst other curated content newsletters.  \r\n\r\nWith it\u2019s plain and simple, easy-to-read information, the Further website is pretty much a guidebook to effectively doing email marketing with curated lists. \r\n\r\n<h3>5. SaaS Weekly<\/h3> \r\n\r\n<img src=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/12\/saas-weekly.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1401\" height=\"809\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-30030\" \/>\r\n\r\nI don\u2019t run a software as a service (SaaS) company. \r\n\r\nHowever, I still subscribe to <a href=\"http:\/\/hiten.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">SaaS Weekly<\/a> \u2014 because it\u2019s that good, and Hiten\u2019s reputation as a content curator is well-established. Not only does SaaS Weekly stand out as a tightly curated library in a niche industry, it also levels up UX with tags that help you browse by categories of interest. \r\n\r\nHis newsletter includes insights for founders, marketing, and more \u2014 all in addition to SaaS. \r\n<h2 id=\"content-curation-tools\">13 Content Curation Tools for Content Marketers<\/h2>\r\nYou can probably find many tool lists out there that include 100+ options. \r\n\r\nThe problem with these lists, ironically, is that they do a poor job of curating \u2014 most of them haven\u2019t actually been used by the writer, and there\u2019s no great way to separate the wheat from the chaff.\r\n\r\nThe below list is a list of tools I recommend and have actually used. \r\n\r\nNot all of them are being used actively, but I\u2019ve at least tested them out and know they have a great use-case for the right business.\r\n\r\n<h3>1. Moz Open Site Explorer<\/h3>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/12\/OpenSiteExplorer.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1401\" height=\"975\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-30027\" \/>\r\n\r\n<a href=\"https:\/\/moz.com\/researchtools\/ose\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">OpenSiteExplorer<\/a> might be one of the most underrated content curation tools that exists. \r\n\r\nIt enables one of the hardest things for roundups to do \u2014 link generation.\r\n\r\nIf you curate resources because they generated links previously, you\u2019ll build a network of people who are capable of doing it for you as well.\r\n\r\nThe bigger that network, the more likely it is to happen \u2014 and, therefore, the more likely it is you can rank well with your <a href=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/creation\/seo-content\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">keyword-driven pieces<\/a>. Leave that part out, and you may end up wondering what value you got from this type of content.\r\n\r\n<h3>2. BuzzSumo<\/h3>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/12\/buzz-sumo.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1401\" height=\"888\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-30015\" \/>\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http:\/\/www.buzzsumo.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">BuzzSumo<\/a> is the next-best option in terms of generating long-term value with your curated posts. By finding content with established social success, you improve the likelihood it\u2019ll have success for you.\r\n\r\nAnd, by nature, if others shared the content you\u2019re sharing in a roundup, there\u2019s a greater-than-average chance they may be interested in your content as well. BuzzSumo\u2019s toolset enables you to view sharers, which allows you to pinpoint influencers for distribution.\r\n\r\n<h3>3. PicResize<\/h3>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/12\/pic-resize.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1401\" height=\"1001\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-30028\" \/>\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http:\/\/www.picresize.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">PicResize<\/a> is a simple but powerful tool. \r\n\r\nFor the introductory content marketer without a breadth of skills or access to Photoshop, it enables you to easily create a consistent content aesthetic by cropping and resizing images to your optimal size \u2014 without losing the quality. Add in the free part and it becomes a must-bookmark in the content curators toolset.\r\n\r\n<h3>4. Upwork<\/h3>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/12\/upwork-freelance.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1200\" height=\"528\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-30066\" \/>\r\n\r\n<a href=\"https:\/\/www.upwork.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Upwork\u2019s<\/a> main value from a curation perspective is allowing you to find affordable graphic design resources to quickly photoshop photos together. \r\n\r\nIf you value your time at all, you shouldn\u2019t be doing this yourself \u2014 or having your team do it, because it\u2019s mostly a redundant task, and if you\u2019re doing 50+ images, it can get time-consuming.\r\n\r\nUse the tool to find a few resources who can do it for you at a low hourly rate, and enjoy much better ROI from your efforts.\r\n\r\n<h3>6. Feedly<\/h3>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/12\/feedly.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1401\" height=\"752\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-30019\" \/>\r\n\r\nThere are many RSS readers out there, but I\u2019ve personally settled on <a href=\"https:\/\/www.feedly.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Feedly<\/a> after using Digg Reader for a time.\r\n\r\nThe difference-maker is the built-in share counts \u2014 when you\u2019re sifting through dozens of articles, these numbers offer a solid nudge towards the best, most recent content in your list.\r\n\r\n<h3>7. Ahrefs<\/h3>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/12\/ahrefs.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1401\" height=\"731\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-30013\" \/>\r\n\r\nIn my opinion, <a href=\"https:\/\/ahrefs.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Ahrefs<\/a> is the best keyword research tool on the market. \r\n\r\nIf you\u2019re trying to get value from roundups, you should be using it to map a keyword against your topic idea. Other than just giving you keyword research data, it\u2019s also a valuable competitive research tool that makes it easier to uncover high value search terms.\r\n\r\n<h3>8. Mailshake<\/h3>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/12\/mailshake.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1401\" height=\"731\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-30023\" \/>\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http:\/\/www.contentmarketer.io\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Mailshake<\/a> scans your blog post and then spits out the contact information of the people you need to reach out to to notify that you included them on your post. \r\n\r\nIt also allows you to include an email template and send for said outreach, which dramatically increases the speed if you\u2019re executing this process at scale.\r\n\r\n<h3>9. BuzzStream<\/h3>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/12\/buzzstream.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1401\" height=\"670\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-30016\" \/>\r\n\r\nIf you\u2019re executing this process at scale, <a href=\"http:\/\/www.buzzstream.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">BuzzStream<\/a> makes sure you don\u2019t burn bridges. \r\n\r\nIf you play in a space that isn\u2019t gigantic, there\u2019s a good chance you might include the same people more than once. If that\u2019s the case, it would turn spammy quickly if you reached out to them every time.\r\n\r\nTherefore, a tool like BuzzStream is perfect to pick and choose your opportunities and not saturate people with mention emails in case you\u2019ve forgotten or have multiple team members working on outreach. \r\n\r\nOnce you\u2019ve mentioned outreach a few times, the people you notify should become followers. If not, you\u2019ve done something wrong and most likely, failed to impress the audience you\u2019re reaching out to.\r\n\r\n<h3>10. Followerwonk<\/h3>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/12\/Followerwonk.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1401\" height=\"1041\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-30021\" \/>\r\n\r\nFor any Twitter power user, <a href=\"https:\/\/moz.com\/followerwonk\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Followerwonk<\/a> is a valuable tool.\r\n\r\nIt has many applications that allow you to slice and dice audiences, but for curation purposes, Followerwonk adds value by allowing you to compare follower overlaps in order to determine the likelihood your audience has seen something recently shared.\r\n\r\nIt also allows you to see when your audience is most active, giving you a framework for optimal sharing times if you happen to be discovering content during low-activity periods.\r\n\r\n<h3>11. Curated.co<\/h3>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/12\/curated.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1401\" height=\"750\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-30018\" \/>\r\n\r\nIf you\u2019re thinking about creating an email newsletter that curates links, <a href=\"https:\/\/curated.co\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Curated.co<\/a> is a great shortcut.\r\n\r\nIt makes it easy to quickly build a beautiful email newsletter that also has a home on the web \u2014 reducing friction and giving you an optimal setup to build a massive newsletter audience online.\r\n\r\n<h3>12. Buffer<\/h3>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/12\/buffer.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1401\" height=\"536\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-30014\" \/>\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http:\/\/buffer.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Buffer<\/a>, well known for its tweet scheduling features, also has additional curative benefits as well, such as its ability to easily grab images from posts <a href=\"https:\/\/buffer.com\/extensions\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">using their Chrome extension<\/a>.\r\n\r\nAlthough I\u2019m not a huge fan of scheduling curated content for most situations in order to retain freshness, scheduling definitely has its place. When doing so, Buffer is a great addition to round out your toolset.\r\n<h2>Now It\u2019s Your Turn<\/h2>\r\nWant to start using content curation as part of your marketing strategy? There\u2019s no better way to learn than by doing. \r\n\r\nIf you\u2019re unsure where to start, we understand.\r\n\r\nOperating a business at scale can be difficult.
