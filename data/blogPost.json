AI Content, Not Replacing Humans<\/h2>\r\nDo we think AI content generation tools are something to pay attention to?\r\n\r\nYes, but we don\u2019t think robots are coming for our jobs just yet. Our results show that 19% of businesses who use AI content generation tools report experiencing a very successful content strategy.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, 24% of businesses who don't use AI content generation tools also report experiencing a very successful content marketing strategy.\r\n\r\n<img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-31375\" src=\"\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/02\/content-marketing-trends-ai-generation-tools.png\" alt=\"A data visualization that represents if content marketers plan to use artificial intelligence in 2023 by Siege Media and Clearscope\" width=\"1400\" height=\"700\" \/>\r\n\r\nWhat do we think AI is best used for at this time?\r\n<ul>\r\n\r\n \t<li><strong>Blog title brainstorming:<\/strong> Type in your topic and content ideas to get some extra creativity in your writing process.<\/li>\r\n \t<li><strong>Email engagement:<\/strong> If you\u2019re struggling with email campaigns, AI content tools offer in-app suggestions for delivery times and personalized content.<\/li>\r\n \t<li><strong>Content outlines: <\/strong>Hitting a roadblock?

Generative AI is a force multiplier that will speed up content efforts and yield increased returns.\"\r\n\r\n<strong>Michael King, Founder, <a href=\"https:\/\/ipullrank.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">iPullRank<\/a><\/strong><\/blockquote>\r\n<blockquote class=\"definition\">\u201cThere's certainly a place for AI content in various marketing tactics and some content creation, but it can't compete with the quality that stems from real life experience and expertise. Perhaps that will change over time, but focusing on Google's notion of E-E-A-T is not only great for SEO, but also leads to higher quality content.\u201d\r\n\r\n<strong>Lily Ray, Senior Director of SEO, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.amsivedigital.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Amsive Digital<\/a><\/strong><\/blockquote>\r\n<h2 id=\"link-building\">3. Link Building Is Here To Stay<\/h2>\r\nWhile 64% of B2B businesses currently execute link building in their content marketing efforts versus 36% of their B2C counterparts, <strong>all businesses that incorporate link building report a 45% higher success rate<\/strong> in their overall content strategy than those that don\u2019t.\r\n\r\n<img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-31379\" src=\"\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/02\/content-marketing-trends-link-building.png\" alt=\"A data visualization that shows how prominent link building is in content marketers' strategies in 2023 by Siege Media and Clearscope\" width=\"1400\" height=\"575\" \/>\r\n\r\nHowever, the type of link building matters.\r\n\r\nThere\u2019s evident success in focusing on just passive link building and a plethora of <a href=\"https:\/\/www.siegemedia.com\/marketing\/link-building-strategies\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">link building strategies<\/a> to choose from that can naturally attract links to your site. The economics will continue to favor the use of a passive link strategy, such as with calculators, more than spending time completing manual outreach.\r\n<h3>What the Industry Is Saying<\/h3>\r\n<blockquote class=\"definition\">\u201cGoogle's PR messaging has worked to deflect the importance of links for years, but the reality is they remain significantly effective.\u201d\r\n\r\n<strong>Cyrus Shepard, Founder, <a href=\"https:\/\/zyppy.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Zyppy<\/a><\/strong><\/blockquote>\r\n<h2 id=\"content-design\">4.

Instead, the design within the content adds more value to the post itself, along with your content navigation and hub.\r\n\r\nTopical content like \u201cwhat is\u201d and informational posts are becoming more competitive as the SERP pages. Leveling up the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.siegemedia.com\/seo\/blog-best-practices-seo\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">blog design<\/a> around these types of content will help you stand out from the competition and improve your chances of ranking higher.\r\n<h2 id=\"interactive-content\">5. Don\u2019t Sleep on Interactive Content<\/h2>\r\nIt\u2019s no secret that interactives are magnets for link building and can almost single-handedly power your link acquisition strategy.\r\n\r\n<img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-31378\" src=\"\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/02\/content-marketing-trends-interactives.png\" alt=\"A graph that shows if content marketers are currently using interactive content in their content strategy by Siege Media and Clearscope\" width=\"1400\" height=\"575\" \/>\r\n\r\nPlus, it\u2019s significantly harder for a competitor to replicate that strategy. If you\u2019re a part of the 64% who don't leverage interactives, consider the number of passive links you may be missing out on.\r\n<h2 id=\"full-report\">Get More Trends in the Full Report<\/h2>\r\nUtilizing these upcoming marketing trends sooner than later will not only improve the overall aesthetic of your content but will prove to do well for the overall user experience.\r\n\r\nThese insights help us navigate the current state of our field and keep us ahead of the curve \u2014 increasing the chances of seeing success in content rankings and engagement.\r\n<blockquote class=\"definition\">\u201cIf you're creating content or if you need to start, this impressive data on the field's ins and outs is a must-read.\"\r\n\r\n<strong>Rand Fishkin, Co-Founder, <a href=\"https:\/\/sparktoro.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">SparkToro<\/a><\/strong><\/blockquote>\r\nDive deeper into all of our trends and insights \u2014 and stay ahead of the curve.\r\n\r\nLearn more about the future of AI content generation tools, how businesses budget their content marketing strategy, what it takes to see success, and much more.

Content marketing that uses artificial intelligence (AI). \r\n\r\nThere are a variety of tools on the market, but some of the most exciting \u2014 and maybe problematic \u2014 are the robo-writing tools. These are tools marketers can use to generate blog posts, press releases, website copy, social media copy, or even video scripts. \r\n\r\nMany robo-writers use <a href=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/seo\/gpt3\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">GPT-3,<\/a> an AI language generator created by Open AI. GPT-3 is a complex language model that can generate human-like content from just a few words.\r\n\r\nThe biggest selling point for these tools is that they can create content quickly and at a fraction of the cost of hiring a writer. \r\n\r\nBut you might not want to get rid of your writing staff just yet.\r\n\r\n<h2>Will AI Content Work for SEO?<\/h2>\r\nLet\u2019s address the elephant in the room. We do create human content, so we could see how you might thing we'd be naturally against AI content. That's reasonable, but we have a business value of \"Strive to be Better\" \u2014 and if it means incorporating AI to create better content, we are very happy to do it.\r\n\r\nWe truly believe that AI content marketing can\u2019t replace humans, but it could add value to the content humans create.\r\n\r\nWe see AI being useful for brainstorming titles or post ideas, helping spot grammar mistakes, or giving general suggestions to simplify copy.\r\n\r\nBut we don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s good at creating:\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Comprehensive outlines for SEO content<\/li>\r\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/marketing\/creative-content\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Creative content<\/a><\/li>\r\n<li>A quality long-form narrative<\/li>\r\n<li>Content that's additive to existing results<\/li>\r\n<li>Design that adds value<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n\r\nTo answer the question: Will AI work for SEO content? Well, maybe. But we don&rsquo;t recommend letting it create content from start to finish. And it&rsquo;s definitely not going to replace human creativity anytime soon.\r\n\r\n<h2>The Pitfalls Of AI Generated Content<\/h2>\r\nLet's try something really fast.\r\n\r\nI'm going to show you two pieces of content highlighting some of the pitfalls of AI content writing tools. \r\n\r\nOne's human ... the other ... isn\u2019t.\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/02\/human-writing-vs-ai-writing.png\" alt=\"An image comparing the differences between human-generated copy and ai-generated copy\" width=\"1400\" height=\"1663\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-31196 bordered\" \/>\r\n\r\nMaybe that example is a little extreme. I mean, I\u2019m pretty sure I\u2019m human, so if I really focus, I can nail that whole conversational tone, right? \r\n\r\nLet\u2019s take a deeper look here and dissect what makes my writing human and AI writing not. \r\n\r\n<h3>Voice And Tone Matter<\/h3>\r\nAs you read this, think about how it might sound. \r\n\r\nThe pauses. The cadence. The tone. \r\n\r\nAI hasn\u2019t grasped the nuances of human language. It's built on great big data sets, and while it can spot patterns with natural language processing, it doesn't feel anything. That's super important when you want a piece of content that engages readers. \r\n\r\nAnyone, man or robot, can spew out an informative piece of content that satisfies the absolute bare minimum that Google wants. And you know what? It may even get you to the first page if it&rsquo;s not <a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=Yx997SsiYlw&amp;t=1334s\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">flagged as spam<\/a>.\r\n\r\nBut look at top content producers. Look at the SEO heavyweights. \r\n\r\nThey have a voice. \r\n\r\nThat&rsquo;s what turns a good blog post <a href=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/creation\/what-makes-good-blog-post\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">into a great one<\/a>.\r\n\r\n<h3>AI Content Is Limited To Fragments<\/h3>\r\nAI content writing tools create content by scraping the web for relevant posts and then stitching it together so that it's vaguely readable.\r\n\r\nThat means it can only create something that already exists in one form or another. Oftentimes, when it\u2019s slapped together, it doesn\u2019t feel like a single piece of fluid content.\r\n\r\nEver seen the movie <a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=lyy7y0QOK-0\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Chappie<\/a>? It&rsquo;s about an innocent robot whose genius creator tries to instill wholesome moral teachings, but the robot is stolen by a quirky pair of gangsters looking for trouble.\r\n\r\nThroughout the film, the robot, Chappie, adopts different traits from both of its teachers. I\u2019ll save you the synopsis, but you can notice a little of this in these AI content writing tools.\r\n\r\nBecause they pull info from anywhere and everywhere and then Frankenstein it all together, you may end up with a piece of content that\u2019s a little bit wholesome computer wiz and a little bit criminal underground.\r\n\r\nEven worse, there\u2019s no guarantee that it\u2019s original \u2014 this comes with its own problems. \r\n\r\n<h3>Design Is Everything<\/h3>\r\nWe love our designers here at Siege. We genuinely couldn\u2019t do this without them.\r\n\r\nDesign is a huge part of <a href=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/seo\/how-to-rank-higher-on-google\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">creating content that ranks<\/a>.\r\n\r\nOur design strategy begins as we\u2019re outlining a post. We chat with designers throughout the entire process, sharing ideas to hone in on exactly the visualization we feel a piece of content needs to take it to the next level.\r\n\r\nSure, AI can \u201cdesign,\u201d but you\u2019ll still have to tell it what to create. Plus, the end result can be a little weird, to say the least.\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/01\/human-design-vs-ai-design.png\" alt=\"An image showing two illustrations of human design vs. AI design\" width=\"1400\" height=\"1170\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-31176\" \/>\r\n\r\nNow just imagine trying to tell it to create an infographic showing marketing statistics. \r\n\r\n<h3>AI Kills Creativity<\/h3>  \r\nListen, AI is great. It plays a key role in our daily lives. From traffic lights to Google searches, it\u2019s everywhere. But overreliance on AI can take the spark out of life. No one wants Siri to manage every aspect of their existence, after all.  \r\n\r\nYou need spontaneity and creativity. This is something AI just can\u2019t offer. Creative content is fun to read, and it\u2019s good for rankings. \r\n\r\nThere is a lot that goes into our content ideas here at Siege. In fact, we&rsquo;ve created a whole methodology we like to call <a href=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/creation\/seo-friendly-content#:~:text=Create%20Out%2Dof%2Dthe%2DBox%20Content%20With%20V.I.N.E.S\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">V.I.N.E.S.<\/a> to keep content creative and interesting.\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/keep-readers-entertained-vines-acronym.png\" alt=\"Make creative content by looking to video, images, news, experts, and social for inspiration.\" width=\"1401\" height=\"422\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-28038\" \/>\r\n\r\nV.I.N.E.S. is our out-of-the-box research method. In short, we scour the web for:\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><strong>V<\/strong>ideos<\/li>\r\n<li><strong>I<\/strong>mages<\/li>\r\n<li><strong>N<\/strong>ews<\/li>\r\n<li><strong>E<\/strong>xpert commentary<\/li>\r\n<li><strong>S<\/strong>ocial media<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n\r\nThis helps us create content that readers are actually looking for. \r\n\r\nAI regurgitates what\u2019s already out there, so when Google sees more of the same, why would they rank it higher than what\u2019s tried and true? \r\n\r\nTo drive meaningful results, you need to build meaningful traffic. And that comes from out-of-the-box thinking. Unfortunately, AI content is very far inside the box.\r\n\r\nAnd while AI pulls content from all over, it can\u2019t compete with content built from research across multiple mediums. \r\n\r\nDo you think AI is looking at Etsy shopping trends to create a post about bachelorette party gifts? We\u2019re willing to bet it isn\u2019t. \r\n\r\n<h3>Google Is Smart<\/h3>\r\nAnd its AI is probably better than yours.\r\n\r\nGoogle's AI can tell if your content was written by a human or a robot. And guess what? It&rsquo;s not a fan of robo-content. In fact, it sees AI-generated content as spam, which is <a href=\"https:\/\/www.searchenginejournal.com\/google-says-ai-generated-content-is-against-guidelines\/444916\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">against its guidelines<\/a>.\r\n\r\nEven if it\u2019s good, AI-generated content won\u2019t pass the AI sniff test. Google wants content that engages users and adds value. AI-generated content can only take from what already exists. \r\n\r\nAI content tools can be useful for identifying trends or topics you should cover, but they\u2019re no substitute for quality research and analysis backed up by data. AI won\u2019t create a masterpiece of an article with compelling insight \u2014 it just can\u2019t think like a human can.\r\n\r\n<h3>Quantity Isn\u2019t Always a Good Thing<\/h3>\r\nAI content marketing tools might help create a ton of content quickly. They may even generate some decent short-term results, especially if you\u2019re targeting lower-difficulty terms.\r\n\r\nBut that isn\u2019t necessarily a good thing. In fact, high publishing volume may even hurt your traffic in the long run. Although our data below doesn't reflect AI-generated content, it does reflect low-quality content \u2014 resulting in similar outcomes.\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/02\/high-publishing-volume-long-term.jpg\" alt=\"A graph showing that high publishing volume of content can hurt long term\" width=\"1400\" height=\"800\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-31192\" \/>\r\n\r\nWhy? \r\n\r\nWell, it won\u2019t attract links, and (perhaps more importantly) readers won\u2019t engage with your content. High-quality content will keep readers on the page for longer, showing Google that your content is actually helpful. A burst of lower-quality content that users might not engage with, however, will show Google just the opposite.\r\n\r\n<h2>AI Content Marketing Tools Do Have Some Benefits<\/h2>\r\nSo we\u2019ve been pretty harsh on AI content, but AI content marketing tools do have some benefits. \r\n\r\nThey can spot grammar mistakes you may have missed, improve the readability of your content, and even help cure writer's block. But they\u2019re not a substitute for human creativity. \r\n\r\nIf you insist on using AI content marketing tools, take a look at these dos and don'ts first:\r\n\r\n<strong>Do:<\/strong>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Use AI content tools to help identify gaps in your content strategy. AI can help you quickly research topics and suggest potential titles for your blog posts, articles, or other content.<\/li>\r\n<li>Take advantage of AI's ability to help you with grammar and spelling mistakes. AI tools (mixed with the expertise of a copy editor) can help you catch major spelling and syntax errors.<\/li>\r\n<li>Use AI to test out different ideas before committing to a certain strategy or approach. AI can provide insights into what&rsquo;s performing well in the market, so you don't have to experiment too much on your own.&nbsp;<\/li>\r\n<li>Invest time into learning how AI works and what it can do. The better you understand AI, the more you can get out of it.&nbsp;<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n\r\n<strong>Don&rsquo;t:<\/strong>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Rely solely on AI content tools without any human input or oversight. AI is only as good as the data it is given, so AI content tools should always be double-checked by a human.&nbsp;<\/li>\r\n<li>Use AI to replace creative work entirely. AI can provide insights and help steer your content creation in the right direction, but AI cannot replace creativity or storytelling skills.&nbsp;<\/li>\r\n<li>Forget that AI has limitations. AI isn't perfect, and it's important to remember this and adjust accordingly when creating content with AI content tools.&nbsp;<\/li>\r\n<li>Jump into using AI without doing your own research first. AI tools pull from information across the web, but if you've spent even five seconds on the internet, you know that not all of that information is reliable.<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/01\/dos-and-donts-of-ai-content-marketing-tools.png\" alt=\"An image showing the dos and don&#039;ts of AI content marketing tools\" width=\"1400\" height=\"1400\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-31175 bordered\" \/>\r\n\r\n<h2>What Are Some Of The Top AI Content Marketing Tools?<\/h2>\r\nThere are a ton of AI  tools out there, and they all come with some pretty big promises. And while we don\u2019t use AI content marketing tools at Siege, there are a few that we think are interesting. \r\n\r\n<h3><a href=\"https:\/\/openai.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">OpenAI<\/a><\/h3>\r\nOpen AI just released one of the most exciting leaps in AI content development with its ChatGPT language model.\r\n\r\nIt\u2019s so good, in fact, that I\u2019m going to let it tell you about itself:\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/01\/chatgpt.jpg\" alt=\"An image showing an example of ChatGPT\" width=\"1024\" height=\"396\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-31183\" \/>\r\n\r\nBasically, it\u2019s the most human-sounding AI content tool\u2026ever. And it\u2019s completely free. Though it\u2019s not without its flaws. \r\n\r\nSome of ChatGPT&rsquo;s limitations include:\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Plausible but factually incorrect outputs<\/li>\r\n<li>Rigid and presumptive responses to more open-ended inquiries<\/li>\r\n<li>Overuses some phrases<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n\r\nIt\u2019s also worth noting that there are already other AI tools popping up left and right that aim to detect whether or not AI wrote a piece of content. \r\n\r\nSo, while it may be one of the most advanced and exciting AI tools to date, it\u2019s not quite ready to replace humans completely. But it could be a great resource to speed up and add to your natural creativity and flair. \r\n\r\n<img src=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/01\/chatgpt-2.jpg\" alt=\"An image showing an example of ChatGPT\" width=\"1024\" height=\"396\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-31182\" \/>\r\n\r\nOk, ChatGPT, we get it. \r\n\r\n<h3><a href=\"https:\/\/www.grammarly.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Grammarly<\/a><\/h3>\r\n\r\nMicrosoft Word has had spell check for as long as we can remember, but Grammarly takes it to the next level. \r\n\r\nGrammarly is an AI-powered tool that can help you edit and proofread your content quickly and (mostly) accurately. It also provides suggestions to improve the quality of your writing and even ensure you didn't accidentally plagiarize any of your copy. \r\n\r\nThere is a free version and a paid version. The free version is pretty basic, tagging only the simplest mistakes, while the paid version costs $144 per year and provides suggestions to improve readability, clarity, and delivery.\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/01\/grammarly.jpg\" alt=\"An image showing an example of Grammarly\" width=\"1024\" height=\"600\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-31184\" \/>\r\n\r\nWhile Grammarly is pretty sophisticated, it\u2019s not perfect, so be sure to double-check its suggestions if you do decide to use it.\r\n\r\n<h3><a href=\"https:\/\/hemingwayapp.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Hemingway Editor<\/a><\/h3>\r\n\r\nThe late, great Ernest Hemingway had a knack for keeping things simple. And with Hemingway Editor, you can channel your inner Ernest. \r\n\r\nThe free app can help you edit your copy for clarity, readability, and brevity. It\u2019s a straightforward tool without any bells and whistles. It does one thing, and it does it well.\r\n\r\nAll you need to do is copy a piece of content into the app, and it will show you the content's readability and where you can improve it. \r\n\r\nTake a look: \r\n\r\n<img src=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/01\/hemmingway.jpg\" alt=\"An image showing a screenshot of Hemingway\" width=\"1024\" height=\"600\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-31185\" \/>\r\n\r\n<h3><a href=\"https:\/\/buzzsumo.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">BuzzSumo<\/a><\/h3>\r\nBuzzsumo uses AI to scan the web, analyzing engagement levels and trends to provide you with topic suggestions. It also has built-in search filters so you can easily find what kind of topics are trending and popular within your niche. \r\n\r\n<img src=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/01\/buzzsumo.jpg\" alt=\"An image displaying a screenshot of Buzzsumo\" width=\"1024\" height=\"750\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-31181\" \/>\r\n\r\nUsing it, you'll be able to identify the most engaging content for your target audience quickly. This AI tool is great for helping you create content that will stand out from the competition and maximize your reach.\r\n\r\nBuzzSumo has a free version, but if you want to unlock all of its features, you\u2019ll need to fork out $299 per month. \r\n\r\n<h3><a href=\"https:\/\/www.jasper.ai\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Jasper.ai<\/a><\/h3>\r\nJasper.ai is an AI-powered content generation tool that can help kickstart content creation. \r\n\r\n<img src=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/01\/jasper.jpg\" alt=\"An image showing an example of Jasper\" width=\"1024\" height=\"750\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-31186\" \/>\r\n\r\nThis tool can take a single sentence and turn it into an entire blog post, article, or webpage in minutes. But that doesn't mean the content is always good \u2014 or unique. And don\u2019t forget, Google sees AI-generated content as spam, which is a big no-no. \r\n\r\nYou can use Jasper for inspiration, but be careful not to use it as a crutch! \r\n\r\nAt $109 per month, it's not for everyone, so consider if you really need AI-powered content creation or if a human writer can serve the same purpose.\r\n\r\n<h2>So, Is AI Easy-Mode For Content Creators?<\/h2>\r\n\r\nOf course, we\u2019re averse to AI content tools here at Siege. They\u2019re in competition with our business model. But we\u2019ll be the first to acknowledge that they could be helpful if you use them correctly.  And at the rate things are developing, it would be silly not to acknowledge how important these tools could become.\r\n\r\nAI content marketing tools can save time, spot errors, and improve the quality of content. But it'll be a long time before they replace human writers. \r\n\r\nAt Siege, we take serious pride in our content, and good content is built on creativity, not cutting corners. \r\n\r\nReady to create something amazing together? <a href=\"https:\/\/siegemedia.com\/business-form\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Drop us a line<\/a>."
